when
we
took
our
seats
at
the
breakfast
table
it
was
with
the
feeling
of
being
no
longer
looked
upon
as
connected
in
any
way
with
this
case
.
"*/3081-166546-0001.lab"
instantly
they
absorbed
all
my
attention
though
i
dared
not
give
them
a
direct
look
and
continued
to
observe
them
only
in
the
glass
.
"*/3081-166546-0002.lab"
yes
and
a
very
respectable
one
.
"*/3081-166546-0003.lab"
the
lady
is
not
the
mother
of
the
boys
but
their
aunt
.
"*/3081-166546-0004.lab"
the
boys
belong
to
the
gentleman
who
is
a
widower
.
"*/3081-166546-0005.lab"
george
nodded
.
"*/3081-166546-0006.lab"
the
boys
look
wide
awake
enough
if
the
father
does
not
.
"*/3081-166546-0007.lab"
do
they
still
insist
that
miss
challoner
was
the
only
person
in
the
room
with
them
at
this
time
.
"*/3081-166546-0008.lab"
george
.
"*/3081-166546-0009.lab"
have
you
ever
thought
that
she
might
have
been
a
suicide
.
"*/3081-166546-0010.lab"
i
know
it
sounds
foolish
but
the
alternative
is
so
improbable
.
"*/3081-166546-0011.lab"
the
boys
look
wide
awake
enough
but
who
can
tell
i
would
sooner
believe
that
.
"*/3081-166546-0012.lab"
a
man
was
looking
in
from
the
corridor
behind
at
the
four
persons
we
were
just
discussing
.
"*/3081-166546-0013.lab"
i
inquired
of
george
with
my
eyes
still
on
this
furtive
watcher
.
"*/3081-166546-0014.lab"
i
took
quite
a
fancy
to
him
why
.
"*/3081-166546-0015.lab"
i
am
looking
at
him
now
.
"*/3081-166546-0016.lab"
just
an
everyday
detective
but
ambitious
i
suppose
and
quite
alive
to
the
importance
of
being
thorough
.
"*/3081-166546-0017.lab"
yes
he's
mercurial
in
all
his
movements
.
"*/3081-166546-0018.lab"
what
does
he
want
.
"*/3081-166546-0019.lab"
i
asked
as
soon
as
george
had
returned
to
my
side
.
"*/3081-166546-0020.lab"
he
wants
me
to
stand
ready
to
obey
any
summons
the
police
may
send
me
.
"*/3081-166546-0021.lab"
i
emphasised
complacently
.
"*/3081-166546-0022.lab"
he
appeared
to
know
for
he
told
me
at
once
that
he
was
detective
gryce
a
man
who
had
grown
old
in
solving
just
such
baffling
problems
as
these
.
"*/3081-166546-0023.lab"
he
gave
up
work
some
time
ago
i
have
been
told
my
husband
went
on
but
evidently
a
great
case
still
has
its
allurement
for
him
.
"*/3081-166546-0024.lab"
the
trail
here
must
be
a
very
blind
one
for
them
to
call
him
in
.
"*/3081-166546-0025.lab"
i
wish
we
had
not
left
so
soon
.
"*/3081-166546-0026.lab"
he
was
late
of
course
but
when
he
did
appear
i
almost
forgot
our
usual
greeting
in
my
hurry
to
ask
him
if
he
had
seen
the
evening
papers
.
"*/3081-166546-0027.lab"
however
a
little
later
we
had
a
comfortable
chat
.
"*/3081-166546-0028.lab"
it
was
one
which
gave
me
a
small
triumph
over
george
.
"*/3081-166546-0029.lab"
the
suggestion
he
had
laughed
at
was
not
so
entirely
foolish
as
he
had
been
pleased
to
consider
it
.
"*/3081-166546-0030.lab"
their
greeting
was
cordial
and
the
lines
on
the
latter's
face
relaxed
a
little
as
he
met
the
still
bright
eye
of
the
man
upon
whose
instinct
and
judgment
so
much
reliance
had
always
been
placed
.
"*/3081-166546-0031.lab"
this
is
very
good
of
you
he
began
glancing
down
at
the
aged
detective's
bundled
up
legs
and
gently
pushing
a
chair
towards
him
.
"*/3081-166546-0032.lab"
it's
the
most
inexplicable
there
.
"*/3081-166546-0033.lab"
but
clews
there
are
absolutely
none
.
"*/3081-166546-0034.lab"
that
is
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
any
perhaps
you
can
.
"*/3081-166546-0035.lab"
at
least
that
is
what
we
hope
.
"*/3081-166546-0036.lab"
it's
a
case
in
a
thousand
gryce
.
"*/3081-166546-0037.lab"
the
old
man's
eyes
shot
fire
and
unconsciously
one
foot
slipped
to
the
floor
.
"*/3081-166546-0038.lab"
she
had
no
companion
near
her
.
"*/3081-166546-0039.lab"
no
word
no
cry
just
a
collapse
and
sudden
fall
.
"*/3081-166546-0040.lab"
in
olden
days
they
would
have
said
struck
by
a
bolt
from
heaven
.
"*/3081-166546-0041.lab"
what
do
you
make
of
it
gryce
.
"*/3081-166546-0042.lab"
i
should
like
to
see
the
desk
you
speak
of
and
the
spot
where
she
fell
.
"*/3081-166546-0043.lab"
a
young
fellow
who
had
been
hovering
in
the
background
at
once
stepped
forward
.
"*/3081-166546-0044.lab"
he
was
the
plain
faced
detective
who
had
spoken
to
george
.
"*/3081-166546-0045.lab"
this
sweetwater
as
they
called
him
was
i
have
since
understood
one
of
his
proteges
and
more
or
less
of
a
favourite
.
"*/3081-166546-0046.lab"
been
over
the
ground
studied
the
affair
carefully
.
"*/3081-166546-0047.lab"
very
well
then
you're
in
a
position
to
pioneer
me
.
"*/3081-166546-0048.lab"
well
well
that's
honest
at
all
events
.
"*/3081-166546-0049.lab"
but
i'm
in
no
position
to
make
promises
.
"*/3081-166546-0050.lab"
old
days
don't
return
for
the
asking
.
"*/3081-166546-0051.lab"
whether
he
got
anything
else
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
from
his
manner
as
he
finally
sank
into
a
chair
by
one
of
the
openings
and
looked
down
on
the
lobby
below
.
"*/3081-166546-0052.lab"
one
or
two
of
the
musicians
from
the
end
of
the
hall
.
"*/3081-166546-0053.lab"
naturally
they
reached
her
first
.
"*/3081-166546-0055.lab"
honest
germans
men
who
have
played
here
for
years
.
"*/3081-166546-0056.lab"
who
came
next
on
the
scene
some
people
from
the
lobby
.
"*/3081-166546-0057.lab"
anybody
before
the
father
came
in
.
"*/3081-166546-0059.lab"
i
suppose
she
has
been
carefully
questioned
very
i
should
say
.
"*/3081-166546-0060.lab"
and
she
speaks
of
no
weapon
.
"*/3081-166546-0061.lab"
not
till
the
doctor
came
her
doctor
who
was
happily
in
his
office
in
this
very
building
.
"*/3081-166546-0062.lab"
yes
mister
slater
the
assistant
manager
who
was
in
the
lobby
at
the
time
says
that
ten
minutes
at
least
must
have
elapsed
.
"*/3081-166546-0063.lab"
no
doubt
.
"*/3081-166546-0064.lab"
sweetwater
someone
drew
that
weapon
out
.
"*/3081-166546-0065.lab"
not
altogether
by
me
.
"*/3081-166546-0066.lab"
wherever
she
pleases
only
i
can't
walk
far
.
"*/3081-166546-0067.lab"
it
has
not
been
running
since
last
night
or
it
would
be
full
of
curious
people
all
the
time
hustling
to
get
a
glimpse
of
this
place
.
"*/3081-166546-0068.lab"
but
they'll
put
a
man
on
for
you
.
"*/3081-166546-0069.lab"
very
good
manage
it
as
you
will
.
"*/3081-166546-0070.lab"
i'll
wait
here
till
you're
ready
explain
yourself
to
the
lady
tell
her
i'm
an
old
and
rheumatic
invalid
who
has
been
used
to
asking
his
own
questions
.
"*/3081-166546-0071.lab"
as
her
quiet
figure
appeared
in
the
doorway
sweetwater
stole
a
glance
at
mister
gryce
.
"*/3081-166546-0072.lab"
there
was
no
doubting
them
in
this
instance
.
"*/3081-166546-0073.lab"
yes
.
"*/3081-166546-0074.lab"
for
some
little
time
that
is
it
seemed
long
though
i
believe
it
was
not
more
than
a
minute
before
two
men
came
running
from
the
musicians
gallery
.
"*/3081-166546-0075.lab"
yes
many
times
.
"*/3081-166546-0076.lab"
what
made
the
difference
.
"*/3081-166546-0077.lab"
miss
clarke
started
and
her
sweet
face
showed
a
moment's
perplexity
did
i
she
queried
musingly
.
"*/3081-166546-0078.lab"
no
a
very
natural
one
i
should
say
.
"*/3081-166546-0079.lab"
and
the
glance
she
cast
him
while
not
meeting
his
eye
showed
that
she
understood
the
importance
of
the
admission
.
"*/3081-166546-0080.lab"
i
know
she
said
what
you
are
going
to
ask
me
now
.
"*/3081-166546-0081.lab"
there
was
no
poniard
in
the
wound
.
"*/3081-166546-0082.lab"
the
time
is
narrowed
down
to
one
and
in
that
one
miss
clarke
was
the
only
person
to
touch
her
.
"*/3081-166546-0083.lab"
i
will
trouble
you
no
further
.
"*/3081-166546-0084.lab"
sweetwater
help
me
out
of
this
.
"*/3081-166546-0085.lab"
but
vigour
returned
to
him
before
he
had
well
reached
the
door
and
he
showed
some
of
his
old
spirit
as
he
thanked
miss
clarke
and
turned
to
take
the
elevator
.
"*/3081-166546-0086.lab"
the
next
minute
she
was
in
this
lady's
arms
.
"*/3081-166546-0087.lab"
no
weapon
protruded
from
the
wound
nor
was
any
found
on
or
near
her
in
the
mezzanine
what
follows
.
"*/3081-166546-0088.lab"
she
struck
the
blow
herself
and
the
strength
of
purpose
which
led
her
to
do
this
gave
her
the
additional
force
to
pull
the
weapon
out
and
fling
it
from
her
.
"*/3081-166546-0089.lab"
it
did
not
fall
upon
the
floor
around
her
therefore
it
flew
through
one
of
those
openings
into
the
lobby
and
there
it
either
will
be
or
has
been
found
.
"*/3170-137482-0000.lab"
with
an
education
which
ought
to
have
ensured
me
an
honourable
standing
in
the
world
with
some
intelligence
wit
good
literary
and
scientific
knowledge
and
endowed
with
those
accidental
physical
qualities
which
are
such
a
good
passport
into
society
i
found
myself
at
the
age
of
twenty
the
mean
follower
of
a
sublime
art
in
which
if
great
talent
is
rightly
admired
mediocrity
is
as
rightly
despised
.
"*/3170-137482-0001.lab"
i
was
compelled
by
poverty
to
become
a
member
of
a
musical
band
in
which
i
could
expect
neither
esteem
nor
consideration
and
i
was
well
aware
that
i
should
be
the
laughing
stock
of
the
persons
who
had
known
me
as
a
doctor
in
divinity
as
an
ecclesiastic
and
as
an
officer
in
the
army
and
had
welcomed
me
in
the
highest
society
.
"*/3170-137482-0002.lab"
i
felt
that
in
my
first
profession
as
i
was
not
blessed
with
the
vocation
necessary
to
it
i
should
have
succeeded
only
by
dint
of
hypocrisy
and
i
should
have
been
despicable
in
my
own
estimation
even
if
i
had
seen
the
purple
mantle
on
my
shoulders
for
the
greatest
dignities
cannot
silence
a
man's
own
conscience
.
"*/3170-137482-0003.lab"
besides
i
was
of
opinion
that
a
man's
profession
whatever
it
might
be
ought
to
supply
him
with
enough
money
to
satisfy
all
his
wants
and
the
very
poor
pay
of
an
officer
would
never
have
been
sufficient
to
cover
my
expenses
because
my
education
had
given
me
greater
wants
than
those
of
officers
in
general
.
"*/3170-137482-0004.lab"
our
scandalous
proceedings
often
exposed
us
to
the
greatest
danger
.
"*/3170-137482-0005.lab"
we
would
very
often
spend
the
whole
night
rambling
about
the
city
inventing
and
carrying
into
execution
the
most
impertinent
practical
jokes
.
"*/3170-137482-0006.lab"
we
did
the
same
with
physicians
whom
we
often
sent
half
dressed
to
some
nobleman
who
was
enjoying
excellent
health
.
"*/3170-137482-0007.lab"
whenever
we
could
contrive
to
get
into
a
church
tower
we
thought
it
great
fun
to
frighten
all
the
parish
by
ringing
the
alarm
bell
as
if
some
fire
had
broken
out
but
that
was
not
all
we
always
cut
the
bell
ropes
so
that
in
the
morning
the
churchwardens
had
no
means
of
summoning
the
faithful
to
early
mass
.
"*/3170-137482-0008.lab"
this
is
the
amusing
adventure
which
closed
our
exploits
.
"*/3170-137482-0010.lab"
yet
there
are
a
few
private
rooms
which
contain
a
table
surrounded
with
benches
in
which
a
respectable
family
or
a
few
friends
can
enjoy
themselves
in
a
decent
way
.
"*/3170-137482-0012.lab"
we
took
our
three
prisoners
to
a
large
boat
.
"*/3170-137482-0013.lab"
where
is
my
husband
.
"*/3170-137482-0014.lab"
never
fear
you
shall
see
him
again
to
morrow
.
"*/3170-137482-0015.lab"
my
readers
may
imagine
whether
we
felt
inclined
to
laugh
when
the
charming
creature
bade
us
good
night
thanking
us
all
with
perfect
good
faith
.
"*/3170-137482-0016.lab"
two
days
afterwards
our
nocturnal
orgy
began
to
be
talked
of
.
"*/3170-137482-0017.lab"
it
went
on
to
say
that
the
two
men
who
had
carried
her
off
had
taken
her
to
such
a
place
where
they
had
an
hour
later
been
met
by
the
other
six
and
that
they
had
all
repaired
to
the
two
swords
where
they
had
spent
an
hour
in
drinking
.
"*/3170-137482-0018.lab"
there
was
no
cowardly
traitor
amongst
us
although
we
were
all
poor
but
fear
had
its
effect
and
our
nocturnal
pranks
were
not
renewed
.
"*/3170-137482-0019.lab"
i
picked
it
up
and
coming
up
to
him
just
as
he
was
going
down
the
steps
i
handed
it
to
him
.
"*/3170-137482-0020.lab"
i
told
him
and
he
insisted
upon
my
coming
with
him
in
the
gondola
saying
that
he
would
leave
me
at
my
house
.
"*/3170-137482-0021.lab"
i
rubbed
it
with
all
my
strength
but
he
told
me
in
a
sort
of
indistinct
whisper
that
the
numbness
was
spreading
all
along
the
left
side
and
that
he
was
dying
.
"*/3170-137482-0023.lab"
taking
everything
upon
myself
i
ordered
a
servant
to
hurry
out
for
a
physician
who
came
in
a
short
time
and
ordered
the
patient
to
be
bled
again
thus
approving
the
first
bleeding
prescribed
by
me
.
"*/3170-137482-0024.lab"
thinking
i
had
a
right
to
watch
the
sick
man
i
settled
myself
near
his
bed
to
give
him
every
care
he
required
.
"*/3170-137482-0025.lab"
they
did
not
know
who
i
was
and
did
not
like
to
ask
me
whilst
i
thought
it
better
to
preserve
a
modest
silence
.
"*/3170-137482-0026.lab"
he
had
gambled
and
lost
a
great
deal
and
his
brother
was
his
most
bitter
enemy
because
he
was
infatuated
with
the
idea
that
he
had
tried
to
poison
him
.
"*/3170-137482-0027.lab"
the
physician
who
attended
him
was
named
terro
he
thought
by
some
peculiar
train
of
reasoning
that
he
could
cure
him
by
applying
a
mercurial
ointment
to
the
chest
to
which
no
one
raised
any
objection
.
"*/3170-137482-0028.lab"
delighted
with
such
a
fortunate
result
we
lay
down
again
.
"*/3170-137482-0029.lab"
he
entreated
me
to
tell
him
the
truth
.
"*/3170-137482-0030.lab"
what
extraordinary
things
will
sometimes
occur
from
mere
chance
or
from
the
force
of
circumstances
.
"*/3170-137482-0031.lab"
unwilling
to
hurt
his
vanity
by
telling
him
that
he
was
mistaken
i
took
the
wild
resolution
of
informing
him
in
the
presence
of
his
two
friends
that
i
possessed
a
certain
numeral
calculus
which
gave
answers
also
in
numbers
to
any
questions
i
liked
to
put
.
"*/3170-137482-0032.lab"
i
obeyed
implicitly
and
met
your
excellency
.
"*/3170-137482-0033.lab"
the
three
friends
were
astounded
.
"*/3170-137482-0034.lab"
i
declared
myself
quite
willing
for
it
was
necessary
to
brazen
it
out
after
having
ventured
as
far
as
i
had
done
.
"*/3170-137482-0035.lab"
he
wrote
the
question
and
gave
it
to
me
i
read
it
i
could
not
understand
either
the
subject
or
the
meaning
of
the
words
but
it
did
not
matter
i
had
to
give
an
answer
.
"*/3170-137482-0036.lab"
if
the
question
was
so
obscure
that
i
could
not
make
out
the
sense
of
it
it
was
natural
that
i
should
not
understand
the
answer
.
"*/3170-137482-0037.lab"
they
all
asked
me
how
long
i
would
require
to
teach
them
the
rules
of
my
sublime
calculus
.
"*/3170-137482-0038.lab"
not
very
long
i
answered
and
i
will
teach
you
as
you
wish
although
the
hermit
assured
me
that
i
would
die
suddenly
within
three
days
if
i
communicated
my
science
to
anyone
but
i
have
no
faith
whatever
in
that
prediction
.
"*/3170-137482-0039.lab"
they
believed
that
through
me
they
possessed
the
philosopher's
stone
the
universal
panacea
the
intercourse
with
all
the
elementary
heavenly
and
infernal
spirits
they
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
thanks
to
my
sublime
science
they
could
find
out
the
secrets
of
every
government
in
europe
.
"*/3170-137482-0040.lab"
but
although
believing
fully
in
my
oracles
they
were
too
kind
hearted
to
think
them
the
work
of
the
devil
and
it
suited
their
natural
goodness
better
to
believe
my
answers
inspired
by
some
heavenly
spirit
.
"*/3170-137482-0041.lab"
they
were
not
only
good
christians
and
faithful
to
the
church
but
even
real
devotees
and
full
of
scruples
.
"*/3170-137482-0042.lab"
as
for
the
eucharist
transubstantiation
the
real
presence
it
was
all
no
mystery
to
them
but
palpable
evidence
and
yet
they
were
not
jesuits
.
"*/3170-137482-0043.lab"
i
might
be
told
that
if
i
had
wished
to
follow
the
rules
of
pure
morality
i
ought
either
to
have
declined
intimate
intercourse
with
them
or
to
have
undeceived
them
.
"*/3170-137482-0044.lab"
besides
i
found
it
very
flattering
to
my
vanity
to
become
the
subject
of
the
speculative
chattering
of
empty
fools
who
having
nothing
else
to
do
are
always
trying
to
find
out
the
cause
of
every
moral
phenomenon
they
meet
with
which
their
narrow
intellect
cannot
understand
.
"*/3170-137482-0045.lab"
whoever
you
may
be
i
am
indebted
to
you
for
my
life
.
"*/3170-137482-0046.lab"
your
apartment
is
ready
you
may
send
your
clothes
you
shall
have
a
servant
a
gondola
at
your
orders
my
own
table
and
ten
sequins
a
month
.
"*/3170-137482-0047.lab"
you
need
not
think
of
the
future
think
only
of
enjoying
yourself
and
take
me
as
your
adviser
in
everything
that
may
happen
to
you
in
everything
you
may
wish
to
undertake
and
you
may
be
certain
of
always
finding
me
your
friend
.
"*/3170-137482-0048.lab"
i
threw
myself
at
his
feet
to
assure
him
of
my
gratitude
and
embraced
him
calling
him
my
father
.
"*/3853-163249-0000.lab"
her
meeting
with
letty
was
indescribably
tender
and
the
days
that
followed
were
pretty
equally
divided
between
her
and
her
brother
in
nursing
the
one
and
loving
the
other
.
"*/3853-163249-0001.lab"
but
even
while
she
enjoyed
every
hour
of
life
and
begrudged
the
time
given
to
sleep
she
felt
as
if
the
dream
was
too
beautiful
to
last
and
often
said
.
"*/3853-163249-0002.lab"
so
christie
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
her
prophetic
soul
and
gave
herself
up
to
the
blissful
holiday
that
had
come
at
last
.
"*/3853-163249-0003.lab"
nothing
can
surprise
me
now
i'm
prepared
for
any
thing
even
the
sight
of
my
quakerish
lover
dancing
a
jig
.
"*/3853-163249-0004.lab"
i
feel
like
a
boy
out
of
school
or
rather
a
man
out
of
prison
and
must
enjoy
my
liberty
in
some
way
.
"*/3853-163249-0005.lab"
i'm
not
a
talker
you
know
and
as
the
laws
of
gravitation
forbid
my
soaring
aloft
anywhere
i
can
only
express
my
joyfully
uplifted
state
of
mind
by
prancing
as
you
call
it
.
"*/3853-163249-0006.lab"
i
don't
want
you
to
i
love
to
see
you
so
young
and
happy
only
you
are
not
the
old
david
and
i've
got
to
get
acquainted
with
the
new
one
.
"*/3853-163249-0007.lab"
i
hope
you'll
like
him
better
than
the
frost
bitten
old
david
you
first
knew
and
were
kind
enough
to
love
.
"*/3853-163249-0008.lab"
mother
says
i've
gone
back
to
the
time
before
we
lost
letty
and
i
sometimes
feel
as
if
i
had
.
"*/3853-163249-0009.lab"
in
that
case
you
will
find
me
a
proud
impetuous
ambitious
fellow
christie
and
how
will
that
suit
.
"*/3853-163249-0010.lab"
excellently
i
like
pride
of
your
sort
impetuosity
becomes
you
for
you
have
learned
to
control
it
if
need
be

the

is
best
of
all

shall

to
show

"*/3853-163249-0012.lab"
then
they
went
back
to
their
work
little
dreaming
as
they
tied
roses
and
twined
smilax
wreaths
how
near
that
other
chance
was
how
soon
they
were
to
be
called
upon
to
keep
their
promise
and
how
well
each
was
to
perform
the
part
given
them
in
life
and
death
.
"*/3853-163249-0013.lab"
to
no
home
in
the
land
did
the
great
trouble
bring
a
more
sudden
change
than
the
little
cottage
in
the
lane
.
"*/3853-163249-0014.lab"
david
was
sober
enough
now
and
went
about
his
work
with
a
grim
set
to
his
lips
and
a
spark
in
his
eyes
that
made
the
three
women
look
at
one
another
pale
with
unspoken
apprehension
.
"*/3853-163249-0015.lab"
it
is
terrible
and
yet
glorious
.
"*/3853-163249-0016.lab"
david
held
it
close
in
both
of
his
saying
gratefully
thank
you
mother
then
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
younger
yet
not
dearer
women
he
added
with
a
ring
in
his
voice
that
made
their
hearts
answer
with
a
prompt
ay
ay
in
spite
of
love
or
fear
.
"*/3853-163249-0017.lab"
the
boys
bless
their
brave
hearts
have
done
nobly
but
older
men
are
needed
now
we
cannot
sacrifice
all
the
gallant

we
who
have
more
to
lose

must
take

and
try
to
do

answered
bravely
forgetting
in
the
fervor
of

what
heavy

see

will
take
the

off

like

about

protect

"*/3853-163249-0021.lab"
i
knew
you
would
go

saw
you
getting

made
up
my

follow

you
will
let
me
do
it
and
in
return
i
will
marry

you
ask

answered
christie
sealing
the

with
a
kiss
that
silenced

you've
something

next
evening
as
missus
sterling
sat
alone
in
the
twilight
a
tall
man
in
army
blue
entered
quietly
stood
watching
the
tranquil
figure
for
a
moment
then
went
and
knelt
down
beside
it
saying
with
a
most
unsoldierly
choke
in
the
voice
.
"*/3853-163249-0025.lab"
the
loyal
frenzy
fell
upon
the
three
quiet
women
and
they
could
not
do
too
much
for
their
country
.
"*/3853-163249-0026.lab"
it
would
have
taken
many
knapsacks
to
hold
all
the
gifts
showered
upon
him
by
his
friends

neighbors

"*/3853-163249-0027.lab"
finding
that
lisha
showed
little
enthusiasm
on
the
subject
she
tried
to
rouse
him
by
patriotic
appeals
of
various
sorts

"*/3853-163249-0028.lab"
very
well
said
missus
wilkins
resolutely
to
herself
ef
i
can't
make
no
impression
on

i
will
on
his

see
how
that'll
work

can't

he
was
not
as
unmoved
as
he
seemed
by
the
general
excitement
and
had
felt
sundry
manly
impulses
to
up
and
at
em
when
his
comrades
in
the
shop
discussed
the
crisis
with
ireful
brandishing
of
awls
and
vengeful
pounding
of
sole
leather
as
if
the
rebels
were
under

"*/3853-163249-0031.lab"
to

the

rose

"*/3853-163249-0035.lab"
and
the
inconsistent
woman
fell
upon
his
buttony
breast
weeping
copiously
.
"*/3853-163249-0036.lab"
his
wife
fed
him
with
the
fat
of
the
land
regardless
of
consequences
his
children
revolved
about
him
with
tireless
curiosity
and
wonder
his
neighbors
flocked
in
to
applaud
advise
and
admire
every
one
treated
him
with
a
respect
most
grateful
to
his
feelings
he
was
an
object
of
interest
and
with
every
hour
his
importance
increased
so
that
by
night
he
felt
like
a
commander
in
chief
and
bore
himself
accordingly
.
"*/3853-163249-0037.lab"
then
the
good
soul
openly
shouldered
the
burden
she
had
borne
so
long
in
secret
and
bravely
trudged
on
alone
.
"*/3853-163249-0038.lab"
the
women
dropped
their
work
to
look
and
listen
for
his
visits
were
few
and
short
and
every
instant
was
precious
.
"*/3853-163249-0039.lab"
they
knew
what
it
was
without
a
word
missus
sterling
clasped
her
hands
and
bowed
her
head
.
"*/3853-163249-0040.lab"
now
let's
be
brave
and
enjoy
every
minute
of
it

"*/3853-163249-0041.lab"
we
will
what
can
i
do
for

davy
asked
christie
wonderfully
supported
by
the
thought
that
she
was
going
too

"*/3853-163249-0042.lab"
as
a
married
woman
you
will
get
on
better
as
my
wife
you
will
be
allowed
to
come
to
me
if
i
need
you
and
as
my

stopped
there
for
he
could
not
add
as
my
widow
you
will
have
my
pension
to
support
you

"*/3853-163249-0043.lab"
nothing
can
part
us
any
more
not
even
death
for
love
like
ours
will
last
for
ever

"*/3853-163249-0044.lab"
not
one

that's
true
love
christie

"*/3853-163249-0045.lab"
then
they
stood
quite
still
for
a
time
and
in
the
silence
the
two
hearts
talked
together
in
the
sweet
language
no
tongue
can
utter
.
"*/3853-163249-0046.lab"
surely
i
shall
if
i
give
you
and
myself
to
the
cause
and
i
do
it
gladly
though
i
know
that
my
heart
has
got
to
ache
as
it
never
has
ached
yet
when
my
courage
fails
as
it
will
by
and
by
and
my
selfish
soul
counts
the
cost
of
my
offering
after
the
excitement
is
over
.
"*/3853-163249-0047.lab"
david
caught
the
exaltation
and
gave
no
further
thought
to
any
thing
but
the
duty
of
the
hour
finding
himself
stronger
and
braver
for
that
long
look
into
the
illuminated
face
of
the
woman
he
loved
.
"*/3853-163249-0048.lab"
the
roses
are
for
they
remind
me
of
poor
helen
and
the
first
work
i
did
with

was
arranging
flowers
like
these
for
a
dead
baby's
little
coffin

"*/3853-163249-0049.lab"
but
i
think

dress
with

mine
though
i
do
choose
a
sober
wedding
gown
answered
christie
smiling
again
as
she
took
from
a
half
packed
trunk
her
new
hospital
suit
of
soft
gray
woollen
stuff
.
"*/3853-163249-0050.lab"

waiting

ready
love
quite
ready

"*/3853-163249-0051.lab"
you

take

see

"*/3853-163249-0052.lab"
david
and
christie
went
smiling
away
together
and
if
they
shed
any

a

the

flowed
down

was
speaking
in
an

a

that
wheezed
as

deadened
and
oppressed
by
the

on
his

over

to
think

out
a

added

"*/777-126732-0007.lab"
when
he
rose
painfully
the
thrusting
forward
of
a
skinny
groping
hand
deformed
by
gouty
swellings
suggested
the
effort
of
a

summoning
all

disdainfully

intimidated

towards

with

gave

up

the

covered
with

dropped
out

he
remained
staring
at

rooted

to
the

by

dread
of
physical

"*/777-126732-0035.lab"
his
vision
of

had
grown
so
intense
that
the
sound

failed
to
rout
it
this
time

"*/777-126732-0036.lab"
the

settled
down
with

the

up
impetuously

swallowed
the

with
an
audible
gulp
and
at
once
as
though
it
had
been
swift
poison
sank
limply
in
a
sitting
posture
on
the

of

closed

the

was
not
satisfied
with

"*/777-126732-0044.lab"
with

pronounced

loafing
was
all
very
well
for
these

who

to
fall
back
upon

had
a

to
provide

"*/777-126732-0048.lab"
these
were
but
few
and
for
the
first
time
since

opened
his

he
took
a
commercial
survey
of
its
value
.
"*/777-126732-0049.lab"
this
survey
was
unfavourable

"*/777-126732-0050.lab"
he
took
the
cash
box
out
of

turning
to
leave
the

became
aware
that

still
downstairs

looked

did
not
ask
him
for

"*/777-126732-0053.lab"

stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the

and
looked
into
the
kitchen
in
silence

"*/777-126732-0054.lab"

watched

gesticulating
and
murmuring

stevie
prowled
round
the
table
like
an
excited
animal
in

cage

"*/777-126732-0056.lab"
the
light
thrown
down
by

shade
fell
dazzlingly
on
the
white
pillow
sunk
by
the
weight
of
her
head
reposing
with
closed
eyes
and
dark
hair
done
up
in
several
plaits
for

night

"*/777-126732-0057.lab"
her
bare
feet
as
if
poked
through
the
bottom
of
an
unadorned
sleeved
calico
sack
buttoned
tightly
at
neck
and
wrists
felt
over
the
rug
for
the

looked
upward
into

husband's
face

your

suddenly
falling
dead
under

thirsty
plain

"*/777-126732-0061.lab"
the

was
as
black
as

was
leaning
his

"*/777-126732-0063.lab"
down
below
in

quiet
narrow
street
measured
footsteps
approached
the

then
died
away
unhurried
and
firm
as

the
passer
by

started
to
pace
out
all
eternity
from
gas
lamp
to
gas
lamp
in
a
night
without

the
drowsy
ticking
of

distinctly
audible

murmured

pause
which
lasted
for
three
ticks

the
clock

"*/777-126732-0065.lab"
this
dread
led
him
to
make
the
remark
that

had
disregarded
his
suggestion
to
go
to
bed

hears

talked
about

were

did

was
out

with
something

overheard
about
eating

flesh
and
drinking
blood
what's
the
good
of
talking
like
that

"*/777-126732-0073.lab"

gets

glared
