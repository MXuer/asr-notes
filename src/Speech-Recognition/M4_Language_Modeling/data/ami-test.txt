 you mean   maybe you should break the wall between the men's room and the women's room   sorry  
  
  
 no  
 uhhuh
 um
 um
 is your person to square meter ratio within the n- university norms
   overall   we don't we don't i mean we don't want people coming in seeing this lavish reading room and and and everyone having their own office if that's not what we are having in the other places we have to make sure that um if for example there's a spare reading room like we were saying before overall your department has doesn't have excessive space per person
 uhhuh
 um right
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 um yeah
 um bu-
 uhhuh
 alright
 well
 it's good in case i ever have to defend it you know it's good to have some numbers if you can come up with some numbers uh
 some
 and maybe uh relative to some other comparable departments that's it's it's good to have that
 but if you both agree with this plan and you think your group will be happy then uh fine with me i don't know about you what do you think yeah  
  
 okay
 alright well thank you
 no problem thank you
 okay
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uh actually martin is fifty per cent time yeah
 no
 oh because you would say that she's an assistant professor or something like that oh okay yeah but um yeah maybe that's
 yeah there are full professors and assistant professors if you want and yeah it's true that she's an assistant professor but uh   well we see maybe we can move a little bit around just to give her uh well also at least maybe not a uh an office alone but at least with just one person not two we'll see
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
  
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah no mountains are just in the far so that's not
 uhhuh
 yeah um well uh i can think of some reactions from the people wi- so maybe i can well r-
 yeah well tell me about some of the constraints and well first of all i must say that there are also quite a lot of common points so um it's probably not going to be very difficult to yeah please thanks perfect so um yeah actually we um well basically the the group who produced this uh proposal is made by susan martin david and uh and myself and we also well susan volunteered to ask maggie and pierrette about how they they felt about sharing offices and so as you can see well um susan gets obviously the same office which is quite a good thing um then things started move a bit it looks like i'm also in the same position but the most obvious constraints that uh we we found here was that it was probably very difficult to have a lounge uh just a lounge in one room because it would block us two full working places
 and although it's true that the group i agree decided to to had to have a lounge we propose to put the lounge uh in the room at the the upper side on on the right uh so let two people share this with uh sort of a yeah a place where we have a sofa maybe and uh and some books so it's obviously a calm place people are not there to talk very loud but they can sit and relax and uh still look at at the mountains um also so that's one of the main differences i think maybe one of the points that we have to talk about
 uh the other one is the admin office so it's gisella fifty per cent because she's only half time and uh the fax machine um gisella actually has a lot of phone calls to make and uh it's true that her activity is quite noisy when she's there um it's also true that she has quite a lot of files for most of the the projects actually that we manage so it appeared at least to well to our group that even if she's here only half time she should have an office by her own because it would be quite disturbing for other people to to work in the the same office uh gisella has has no objection against sharing the office we thought it was more for the the calm of the the people
 it's true that this blocks one of the one person rooms but uh on the other hand uh maggie has no objection uh sharing an office with her assistant and this appeared to be true also of pierrette we don't know about pierrette sharing an office with two persons but at least no problem in pierrette sharing her office with uh marianne the the swedish one who is sort of her assistant um so this is why we yeah we put maggie with with bruno and then the third main difference uh would be the the number of visitor places or free places uh you notice a new name in the room uh at the center upper upper side so that's paola it's true that it's someone coming next year susan reminded me this uh of this point and i could not really ignore it uh so um that she's an italic she will arrive in about two month and the two uh vis one and vis two are the visitor places you had one i think called free space or spare spare place
 um we didn't really reach a very good agreement on the distribution of these two rooms so the the two at the center uh where is written paola yalina the two visitors and then maria plus david so i think there is quite a lot of space here to uh switch a little bit among the people just to make some kind of smooth occupancy rate so not to have one empty room when we have no visitors um and uh then a very full room when everybody is is here so i think we're we are quite willing to split and put say maybe one visitor with maria and david uh fifty per cent in the other room with the second visitor so that it smooth is
 well yeah exactly so the visitors are uh basically stagieur and it happens that sometimes we have two of them even if it's only for three or four month martin seemed to insist that when we have a visiting professor for instance we cannot really put him with gisella because well they wouldn't feel very nice they they made a joke about that
 so we should manage some kind of decent space it's true that these one or two last one or two years we didn't have uh a visiting professor but um
 yeah so uh i think yeah these are the three main points so one is the place of the lounge uh the other one is the uh the place of the admin office with gisella and the third one is the number of visitor visiting people and uh well how many of them we want to accommodate and where where we put it these i think are the three main differences otherwise we pretty much agree on uh on placing people
 uhhuh
 uhhuh um sorry i i didn't understand  
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah that's that's true i think yeah they are are quite open to to this martin also reminded us that he is quite noisy he has a lot of uh phone calls to make even if it's here if he's here only fifty per cent of the time um so yeah i i i don't mind this but uh that's something but it's true yeah we could also try to put a visitor and the professor
 um martin made another point it was the fact that sometimes professor have to professors have to discuss sensitive matters about projects and financing and they sometimes might feel uncomfortable discussing this with their well in the presence of their p  h  d  students like saying oh i i have to reduce her t- from eighty per cent to fifty per cent that's probably something so i- i mean all these are constraints i don't know how how you would like us to proceed from from here or if you already have questions or reactions on this one
 uhhuh
 uhhuh yeah um
 well uhhuh yeah we yeah that's true that's one of the problems um well we were told that it was not really possible to build walls but we noticed that this room actually has two doors so uh we thought that maybe we could put some kind of well separation i- yeah maybe just yeah furniture or just uh some kind of screen
 no it's not soundproof  
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh yeah
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh yeah well it was actually this pressure from from my group that led to this to squeeze a little bit uh the place of the lounge now how for instance would the university feel about a room that would be only used as a lounge would they feel it's too empty and that we have too much space or w- is there no problem the   do do you see a problem with having a l- a room just for a lounge or no
  
 so we could have a separate room as a lounge as long as uh we pack the other offices
 um personally i i have no problem with this so um that's that's fine
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah yeah exactly yeah
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 okay so i think maybe we can agree on on the lounge in a separate room if we can manage to to find space elsewhere what about gisella how do you feel about putting her in a separate office
 which is the case now i think well she has an extra yeah with a visitor space yeah uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah it depends on what kind of visitor you are exactly so we could say some kind of low key visitor this is uh very nice uhhuh
 actually gisella fifty per cent means that she's there half time uh generally in the mornings
 yeah
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 um i think it's what i tried to to do before it's the shared lounge uh th-
 um
 do you have assistants with professors
 yeah no i think this is quite accepted and it's a bit the case no i think it's uh the lounge uh the admin room
 an-
 yeah and the number of slots for visitors and for this new student who arrives because having just one spare place this was probably the strongest disagreement in my group people said uh we should have at least two or three spare places just for you know growing or sometimes you have three interns that arrive so even if they are not perfect places um
 yeah that's yeah that's how we did in in our proposal yeah
 uh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah uhhuh
 but then we need to squeeze in in one of the three person rooms some extra visitor space and uh i i think so if if we want to keep the reading room uh i think it's possible by playing a little bit with the furniture
 um so yeah i think another point here and i don't know how you you feel about it is well the fact that martin is said he would be quite noisy fifty per cent of the time so many phone calls so i wouldn't put him in that big office even if he's fifty per cent but he's still a professor here and we got him from e  p  f  l 
 so that i i think i mean if we need to reach a solution now i i wouldn't mind working from your plan and doing some changes or if you prefer working from mine and doing other changes
 so um
 okay yeah depends how how easy you can write in it   okay so let's keep the reading room uh also i think pierrette pierrette and martin p- should deserve at least i think offices with one person not with two
 uh
 yeah we we never asked them it could be but um on the other side they have i think no real project in common so i wonder
 whe- i- i think i would prefer and probably my group would prefer to see them with the respective assistants and i think pierrette plus marianne is a very good combination
 why not switching them from yeah that office yeah switch the whole group yeah marianne swedish and then pierrette
 because there are two mariannes
 and both family names start with s  t  a 
 no no not true the just s  yes
 uhhuh
 now let's do something with martin too um
 yeah maybe we can write it down say vis vis one david is fifty per cent and visitor one should yeah or spare or it's fine
 uhhuh gisella
 yeah uhhuh i think that's closer to what i said
 well because actually we have this project in common you know call i  m  two
  
   um yeah i think it's and so d- could we um
 uhhuh
   well i think yeah always gisella but i think there is no way to uh
 uhhuh yeah sort of second uh
 um yeah
 so you would put gisella in a one person room yeah yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah we could yeah even put
 we couldn't put maggie and bruno together that's obviously the case
 uhhuh
 no let's leave it like this for the moment how do you feel because your office well three persons and you are all full time in there so you with nancy and maria
 uhhuh yeah and you have parmenides in common with nancy
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 and do you think we could put a visitor with nikos and yalina because it's it's also it's not very clear you know yalina's that we said in our meeting yalina's master thesis should be defended in a couple of months or something like that so we don't really know what happens afterwards so we could at least think it's sort of an open place or we could get that office for you and nancy and put nikos and uh yalina with maria and a visitor what about that wouldn't you like to have a calmer spot  
 yeah yeah but a visitor actually uh doesn't have that much paper so for instance maybe they don't need uh well uh the place to put their files you know a smaller drawer they just need a a desk and probably just one drawer under- underneath
 yeah probably not i think it wouldn't be uh yalina and maybe we could think of a visitor too here
 so that
 think so
 because remember there is also this paola arriving um on the new project so you know susan insisted that uh
 we should be
 and it- it's al- also it's not very clear   because nikos and yalina are well nikos is um research student yalina will finish her master thesis so it's
 yeah okay yeah paola or uhhuh
 or maybe paola will be able to choose
 yeah i think that's quite okay i don't know about any preference of maggie being alone or with bruno or no
 yeah
 um david mentioned also that there should be some kind of gender balance  
 uh i don't know if there is a strong constraint but i think we are doing pretty well
 well so
   i'm not sure that was what was meant but  
 ha
 okay that's fine if he mentioned this to you that's quite nice and okay yeah i'm with martin not very balanced
 uhhuh
 yeah that's why okay if you don't mind me sharing the office with martin that's fine okay yeah that looks good so   agnes with marianne and david yeah so you have i  m  two in common that's nice and he is fifty per cent so that means the office is not very crowded okay the other one is a bit crowded but that's okay gisel-
 uhhuh
 um i i think for the moment  
 uhhuh yeah
 uhhuh well what was said in in my group actually susan who knows professors from other um other faculties well she noticed that most of them have rooms alone
 so this is true for susan and maggie but not true here for pierrette and and and martin so we can already argue that uh we're squeezing in even the the professors it's true that the reading room but you know we fought so much to have it so let's uh let's try to have it there and i think putting four people in a three person room is already a sign that uh we are already quite uh quite full so um i think yeah it's normally the nominal capacity of this i think it's uh eighteen people um eighteen or or seventeen and we're only fifteen if you don't count paola and some visitor's place and i think it's quite important to have space for visitors because if you have no visitors or if you cannot take a new well intern during the summer you're very much handicapped so i think we're yeah on well the reaction of my group was that this was almost full already so i well we tried to
 i thin-
 uhhuh
 yeah so i think yeah what we could say about the reading room is that we we squeeze quite a lot of people in in the other offices so i think it's okay
 um
  
 uhhuh
 perfect just save it   please maybe it's another name just say okay it's fine
 okay
 so my group also asked to circulate the final proposal just to make sure there is no major problem
 and the numbers
 and we're done
 thank you sirs
 yes
 yeah martin
 mar-
 ah
 yeah ho-
 um
 yeah
 um
  
 yeah
 but you no specific uh views for mountains or old town or i mean people prefer any windows
 oh oh
 yeah i guess those thin lines or i mean they're windows or okay
 oh oh k- okay oh okay  
 hmm
 hmm
 yeah yeah
 yeah  
 yeah   yeah yeah
 yeah and then one of old town
 yeah
 oh
 so you can't do any partitions i mean you plan to do any partitions in three p- person rooms or like this kind of blocks
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah just three desks yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah  
 um
  
  
 but how often the lounge is used um
 people uses on regular basis daily basis or
 oh
 yeah
 okay
 hmm
 hmm
 okay
 yes
 yeah
 yeah
 um yeah
 yeah
 um
 yeah
  
 hmm
   yeah hmm
 yeah
  
 um
 yeah
 oh
 yeah
 so you have some oh
 so you have some books also like um hmm
 oh okay
 hmm
 oh
 yeah
 yeah you mean you can display some new journals or a new proceedings and yeah
 yeah yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 uhhuh
  
 you mean these fifty per cents   i mean they're all separate or
  
 yeah
 okay
 yeah okay
 yeah
 i mean they don't okay
 yeah yeah
 yeah okay
 uhhuh
 yeah
 yeah
 and then   secretary has separate room
 yeah okay because
 yeah okay
 um
 um
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 n- d-
 hmm
 yeah
  
 yeah
 maybe can you combine both or like in two person room pierrette too
 yeah martin is fifty per cent
 maybe
 okay
 yeah
 one is finishing  
 oh  
 but then you can create on more spared place in that big three piece room no
 yeah somewhere fifty per cent
  
 yeah yeah yeah
 but then you can move administration to the single room the k- because she's only fifty per cent working and
 and she will
 oh yeah yeah and give that room to f- some professor with a student or from for visitor with the visiting place or
 yeah
 yeah
  
 yeah
 yeah
 but you can't put three desks in the two person rooms
 yeah
   yeah
  
  
 oh um
  
 um
 but even like you can put um paola in administrate office like
 you're already three people um it looks like small room compared to the other three p-
 hmm
  
 yeah
 yeah   k-
  
  
  
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah it's fine  
 uhhuh
 yeah
 yeah
 yep
 thank you
 hello
 yeah yep
 um i've got a powerpoint presentation
 sure
   it's not very long in any case
 yep yeah  
 okay so what i was thinking is basically the previous movies that we had which you've already mentioned in the agenda d- um lawrence of arabia apocalypse now and amadeus were fairly historical serious dramatic and also action ey movies except for maybe amadeus um this month i was thinking of selecting something that's more in the present time still dramatic but slightly less serious
 and what i'd propose is something of a thriller or mystery and i know that a lot of people find mystery is not really mysterious in the movies these days they kind of can predict what's going to happen um but in the nineties there were some movies that did have surprise endings and that people came out saying okay didn't see that coming so i thought we could maybe show one of those and even if people have already seen the movie a lot of the times you go back and watch the movie again and you pick up on things that you didn't really notice the first time around or you see where the clues were and um what led up to the end so that's more along the lines of what i was thinking
 and the two in particular that i would propose are
 next slide please the usual suspects and the sixth sense um i don't know if you've seen any of them uh the usual suspects was directed by bryan singer and written by christopher mcquarrie it has a fairly large cast so i'm not going to read all of them but the main characters are kevin spacey and gabriel byrne and it's basically about five criminals who get set up um they're arrested they're released from prison and the get together um and plan a crime and basically the story is told through the views of one of the suspects
 um   the tag line is kind of neat five criminals one lineup no coincidence and you get told the story um as uh that these f- characters are being controlled um by one sort of uber villain and in the end you find who the uber villain was and i kind of like the   the quote from rolling stone magazine the usual suspects is the freshest funniest
  
 well they ha- have you guys seen the movie
 so i'm not going to give away you want me to give away the movie   that'll spoil it   i'll tell you later   but the the quote from rolling stone is fairly accurate i think it's one of the freshest funniest and scariest crime thrillers to come along since pulp fiction
 and the other movie is the sixth sense with the famous line i see dead people which the little boy says   um it was written and directed by m  night uh shyamalan and stars bruce willis haley joel osment and toni collette and again has a neat twist that you find out right at the end
 yeah
 yeah the sixth sense was very commercial but
 anyways
 it's the poster for the sixth sense but unfortunately i couldn't find a clear big enough one
  
 yeah yeah i th- i think it's only part of a full yeah it goes th- the all of the se- all of the senses um if you go to the next slide there's slightly more detailed things about the movies so the usual suspects is a hundred and five minutes long so it's a decent length of time it has an r  rating so i don't remember what type of audience we had at the last
 uh shows but it may not necessarily be suitable for kids
 r  is sort of if you're eighteen and under you have to have an adult with you
 it's mostly for violence yeah it's restricted um it got an eight point seven out of ten on the internet movie database it's the sixteenth in the top f- two hundred and fifty movies and fourth in the top movies of the nineties it won um a couple of academy awards notably for best writing um so that's for the script um and best actor for kevin spacey
 uhhuh
 yeah fourth in the top movies of the nineties sixteenth in the top two hundred and fifty i think of all time
 yeah
 so it won lots of awards um it won best film from the british um british film association or the british equivalent of the academy awards um it was nominated for best foreign film for the cesar
 plenty of awards yeah  
 i think of all time yeah
 yeah
 so
 yeah
  
 yeah it's ratings by viewers and
 yeah like memories
 yeah and forty four as well which has seven hundred and forty something votes
 yeah so
 yeah   um
 yeah no it's a good movie i   i highly recommend it and i wouldn't mind seeing it again because i do know the ending and i haven't been able to watch it again to see where the hints were that were scattered across the movie because apparently there are hints as to who it is
   yeah okay
 yeah
 and he's the one telling the story yeah
 there's him and the the guy in the burn unit
 the second movie is the sixth sense again it's fairly short it has an easier rating it's p  g  thirteen um it's much less violent it got an eight point one out of ten it's a hundred and first in the top two hundred and fifty and it's nineteenth on your list i think if i'm not mistaken yeah it's nineteenth um got a fair number of votes too ninety six thousand um again it was nominated for a lot of different academy awards um it didn't win any but it got a lot of buzz and a lot of people liked it so
 those are my two selections and as you can see the plot is a boy who communicates with spirits that don't know when they're dead seeks the help of a disheartened child psychologist to figure out why he's seeing what he's seeing and
 what it means
 yeah yeah
 yeah it's only right right at the end where you find out really what's going on and it makes you rethink everything that happened beforehand
 so those would be my two suggestions and y- they ar- they are slightly more commercial or at leas the sixth sense is than the other ones we've seen but
 yeah
 yeah they were they were nominated for a lot of different awards they didn't win
 but i guess the comp- i can't remember what the competition was that year but
 and they were nominated for a lot of them and um
 yeah
 so i think that's it unless you have any questions yeah that's it
 you sent your slides around right yeah
  
 no i haven't i've heard a lot of good things about it i've heard it's a really powerful movie but i haven't seen it
 yeah it's set in a jail
 yeah
 me
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 it's a fairly emotional movie though that's one thing to keep in mind is that it's
 yeah but amadeus isn't really representative of the eighties either   yeah and according to your thing it's nineteen eighty four   so
  
 no
 it is a good movie yeah
 yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah
  
 yeah
 but it gets updated daily
 yeah
 um no
 wait how many of us saw schindler's list three of us did you see it i'm just trying to keep track of how many of us have seen
 you have you have you haven't
  
 i can't remember
 i think also it's old enough that even if people saw it the first time around they don't necessarily remember everything that happened because i remember seeing it when it came out but i don't particularly remember
 so we've all seen it
 is what
 i haven't i don't remember the soundtrack
 yeah i mean if there's something that none of us like we can just eliminate it but we might as well leave everything 'till the end
 no
  
 yeah
 yeah it's a gangster movie
 ray liotta and
 joe pesci i think maybe i think yeah on the right and the guy on the left is ray liotta
 i recognize them
 i'm a movie buff i know way too much about movies and actors and everything
 what was it about
   very descriptive  
 no
  
   a little bit   okay  
 yeah
 uhhuh  
 so the other killer is hannibal lecter who
 yeah he's in jail and he's real- no h-
 he tries to help the f  b  i  agent but he plays head games with the f  b  i  agent at the same time
 and so
 with her he manages to freak her out  
 so
 hannibal lecter is a very
 the moth
 which the one who's in jail or the one who anthony hopkins
 i don't either
 yeah   he's scary in that movie  
 yeah i vaguely remember what it is   but
 how many of us have seen it i'm guessing you haven't seen it or h- okay
 so have we all seen it okay so we've all seen it
 i can't either because i saw it right when it came out
 it came out when ninety one yeah
 so
 yeah me too   and at that age i was like um  
 yeah that was very good yeah
 yeah
  
 yeah   suburban life
 there's a lot of very true things in it
 yeah
 yeah
 it's much less dark than the other movies we have   on that list
 it's not well it's dark but   no
 no
 but not like violent cutting people to pieces psychopaths they're just everyone has their own issues and
 no
 well
 with hi- his daughter his like teenage daughter so that's the best friend and he fantasizes about her and  
 uhhuh
 see i don't know what was mainstream in europe like all of these movies are very mainstream for me
 but
 it has other movies but i think it's predominantly
 no there's movies from everywhere but
 uhhuh
 yeah
 no i've never even heard of it
   oh okay
 thank you
 uhhuh
 it's v- very   very violent
 the landing yeah
 yeah this is not a movie for kids like
 yeah
   yeah
 yeah the redux version is longer
 yeah
 i think just once for this
 oh maybe he did
 no for e  t  he didn't it wasn't until he started doing things like schindler's list and saving private ryan that he actually started winning awards for them
 did he
 oh okay yeah
 i didn't know that
 they re enhanced the color yeah
 that it was their t  v 's and not
 uhhuh
 yeah
 yeah about two thirds of the way through the movie because most of the movie is them find- trying to find him on the front right no no
 yeah he's trying to find him
 private ryan was matt damon i think yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 is it him at the begin- it's him at the beginning of the movie at the at the the graveyard right
 yeah with his family yeah
 i have
  
  
 i don't think so no it was an italian
 uhhuh
 yeah
  
 no
  
  
 uhhuh
 um it's julianne moore isn't it yeah
 uhhuh
  
 hmm
 i quite like that
 uhhuh
 yeah
 yeah
 looks like a c  d  cover  
 yeah
 uhhuh
 oh okay
 i actually don't like it   it looks like two yeah it's it looks like two separate posters
 although i think you can mix i would keep the format of the first one add the quotes and the content information from the second one
 so take those take those quotes get rid of that section   of text put those quotes in there put the the information you had in the second poster about the movie club how to join kind of in the middle and keep this title and everything just slightly higher up
 i think it does i think the contrast between the the the strip of film and or the strip of pictures and everything else is
 yeah
 yeah so take all of that content throw it up into the first one and then maybe add the quotes that you had from the from the famous directors sort of at the bottom or something yeah
  
  
 usual suspects
 mainly because only two of us have seen it and it's not a mainstream movie so i don't think a lot of people would have seen it to begin with
 uhhuh
  
   so you reduced that by what two  
 american beauty and
 wait i'm missing one what am i missing pulp fiction was that one of them okay
   i have seven
  
 okay
 pulp fiction
 i'm not a huge fan of quentin tarantino   and it didn't make a good impression
   really eliminate pulp fiction   it's gone
 we're all going to   vote for something different
 i   i still like the usual suspects but i like american beauty too
 so
 usual suspects
 you have the deciding vote
 yeah
  
 that's fine
 it'll make a good change from the other ones
   if you don't like it it's your problem  
 yeah
 yeah
 ascension
 um okay
 okay
 ninth ninth yeah twenty ninth
  
 hi
 hi everyone
 i haven't
 uhhuh
 yes so who who has what actually maybe um
 uhhuh what do you have mirek
 uhhuh and i have a uh   well just a a piece of paper with some suggestions what about you denis
 uhhuh
 should we start with the two presentations maybe yeah
 uhhuh
 no i haven't seen it
  
 um
 uhhuh
 so w- what what is this s- the second image on the slide is it the the poster or
 has a s- it has a strange format um horizontal and uh so it's one two three four five six
 uhhuh
 so it means restricted uhhuh
 yeah because your table is only the nineties yeah uhhuh
  
 well
 w- w-
 no no actually if you look at your tables i think it's a sort of uh well average between number of votes and and and uh yeah the the rating or th- the marks because there are in you table you have uh things that have very few votes but still are ranked quite high for instance number twenty four which has only four thousand votes
 but um yeah
 yeah maybe it's just the search is compensated a bit for the number of people i i don't know actually because if you have just ten votes and yeah probably are not in the database
 but yeah anyway it has excellent votes haven't seen it but  
   uhhuh
 oh
  
 yep  
 uhhuh
 the last sentence from the movie or oh
 w-
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 so these guys were actually nominated so the the bottom part of your slide actually it says yeah so these are the best awards they had
 okay
   too bad   well there is just one winner so   uhhuh
 okay
 yeah i think your table is very clear denis
  
 no i haven't
 yeah
 w- what is the name in french because
 uhhuh uh yeah
 yeah well actually your third slide has the plot so uh
 yeah
 oh yeah exactly yeah so yeah this guy is jailed okay uhhuh wow
 okay
 yeah
 yeah i haven't seen i heard about it but  
 uhhuh yep
 yeah
  
 um i think there was a celebration of uh sixty years from the liberation of the camps actually because they were liberated beginning forty five and uh yeah it's not bad and it's also i think it's a good idea at at least from my point of view it's coherent with the previous films like history im- major events i don't know if we want to keep this coherence or change radically but maybe yeah that's yeah i think it's a drawback uh
   well of the seventeen eighties
 yeah maybe it's representative of a style of the eighties i don't know as for amadeus but uh   that's i don't know but  
 yeah hard to tell
 uhhuh
 yeah it's funny actually um because on your on your slides actually the ratings are eight point seven for both no they have the same usual suspects and pulp fiction both are at eight point seven but on denis's table uh this one is at eight point six who knows maybe people voted for it yeah could have changed in the meanwhile
 though with one hundred and thousand votes it shouldn't change too much i mean given the number of votes i wonder but anyway it's m- it may change i think yeah
 okay   wow that's encouraging
 no
 haven't
 uh i i've seen very few movies from the list about ten out of the first fifty
 okay yeah
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah i've seen it this one i i like it very much i've actually seen it
 well it's plenty of well known songs and you know the twist thing and  
 oh i would keep it as a candidate but i don't know i think for the moment m- m- guess most of these are candidates so we'll try to
 yeah we should probably vote after everyone
 yeah uhhuh
 yeah
 no  
  
  
 i- you you recognize them or you can read the the text on the images oh okay  
 huh very well
 uhhuh
 yeah
 um okay no yeah so   probably not uh
  
  
 so
 who is in prison actually
 yeah
 no no he tries to decrypt the the the other killers' behavior
 yeah well not very nasty ones or does he i don't know yeah
 yeah that's basically the point yeah   uhhuh so on the picture you can see uh jodie foster and uh   ha ha
 th- th- the moth
 anthony hopkins the other one i don't remember we don't see any h- see him very often but it's
 uhhuh yeah
 but the plot is quite horrible i mean the not the plot but the what the the active killer wants to do is quite horrible and
 um  
 okay
 yeah i've seen it i think i've seen it a second time on t  v  but maybe not entirely
  
   they're much too young
   indeed
   i haven't seen it but i would like to see it so
 uhhuh
  
 uhhuh so it's not very violent really
 ah okay great
 uhhuh
 okay yeah
 uhhuh and what about the well that picture with the the girl and do you see naked people in the movie or is it about sex or something like that
 ah okay
 supposedly   okay
 uhhuh
 okay
 uhhuh
 uhhuh yeah i think it's a mixture of bringing new things to them but also making them enjoy the show so that they come to our movie club so yeah i think we shouldn't maybe do very mainstream movies but well okay the list here is quite uh
 yeah
 yeah i think also if you look at the number of votes here
 uh
 yeah uh regarding the denis's table i would say given that this site i don't know if it's mainly american but uh i would say that
 yeah i think um yeah it's english speaking anyway so uh though so
 yeah but if you look at
 yeah but i would say mainstream are the ones that have more than whatever sixty thousand votes and you can see some more well confidential films that have like ten thousand twenty thousand like um princess mononoke twenty thousand and uh whatever the the kieslowski at eleven thousand the trois coleurs rouge
 yeah it's not bad at all yeah   so yeah anyway if you want a definition of mainstream or whatever
 uhhuh
 yep
 d- uh danish i think it's the dogma movement yeah
 yeah
 yeah let's uh
   yeah   so it's uh actually i have made i have made photocopies i have them denis so it's all for you actually i i tried to propose just one movie with some alternates uh   you want one
 um so my proposal which is only a proposal would be to to keep the focus on um uh more or less history and action so lawrence of arabia was okay about this guy during the first world war so it happens okay outside europe and the states but uh it's a piece of history uh apocalypse now it's uh vietnam if i'm um correct and okay amadeus that's much uh much earlier and it's not about it's not violent which is a nice thing i think but um given that we would like a movie from the nineties i thought the saving private ryan oh thanks for projecting the document
 um would keep this more or less this theme of uh history and war and action drama while showing actually a very new and i would say humanistic view on on war because it's it's not like the sort of glorification of uh you know the good guys that that uh well go against the nazis but uh it's uh it's well the plot actually if you don't know it
 it's about people looking for just one soldier in fact it's um it's about a a family of four brothers who actually three of them get killed during the war in these days of forty well i guess summer forty four and the uh well the government decides that they need to get back the fourth brother just to save one member of the family and this this guy is private ryan
 so the movie is not about killing the germans or whatever it's about saving at least one guy from a family so but of course the the setting is during the war and um it's very realistic and uh very dramatic in fact it's um it's not at all a glorification of war but it's just uh it shows a bit uh the violence of um of the things and especially the the beginning is uh i think it's great it's it's very violent but it's it's an image of of war it's uh
 yeah but i think if um well if you compare it with
 it yeah it's the landing and actually every- more or less everyone gets killed and
 oh i i didn't know but yeah actually it's very well filmed and it's very realistic and i don't know if you compare with i don't know in lawrence of arabia i think they have some battles and camels i know it's very nice someone falls somewhere there and well you know it's like battles that look nice but this one doesn't look nice and i think it's uh it's also maybe representative of the nineties you know people starting to get the more uh realistic view of uh of of war but it's true it's it's a bit violent and so what i put here it's a bit long too it's nearly three hours
 but uh i don't know apocalypse now is quite long too i think
 i don't remember
 uhhuh
 yeah so it won uh five oscar prizes uh best director for steven spielberg um best cimena- cinematography etcetera uh
 i don't know
 oh
 hmm
 uhhuh
 um okay so um yeah that's that's the point it's it's a bit gray and actually if you look at my second page uh in the trivia i found out that in fact they uh actually reduced the the color saturation of the movie just to make it look maybe a bit like the documentaries from the time yeah i was very surprised to find this uh it's
 they they turned back the colors for uh  
 yeah
 yeah so this uh fact number two i think obviously for i mean technical people like us is uh   is is is quite funny so yeah so i i mean these four points could serve also as an introduction if you want to talk f- fo- for fi- five or ten minutes before the movie i don't know in in the room so uh yeah um so tha- this would be my candidate but i'm very much open to
 uhhuh
 yeah on th- on yeah on the picture actually yeah it's tom hanks in fact you you don't see uh private ryan until the end more or less or you see um because they they're looking for him yeah
 uhhuh
 no tom tom
 yeah well the caption says captain john miller so
 so i- if you look at the caption um yep so he's uh he's
 yeah so the private is just a simple soldier actually yeah
 uh who private ryan or no no they find him actually and they send him back to the family but the captain dies actually tom han-
 l-
 oh yeah it's private ryan yeah remembering at the beginning uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah exactly yeah he dies unfortunately so yeah there is sacrifices and
 uhhuh
 oh
 uhhuh
 yeah the german
 uhhuh yeah
 well i mean yeah it has a moral dimension all over the movie you know saving the individual and the guys so yeah i i don't know i don't know how many people have have seen it well among you well most of you actually oh all okay all of us so maybe th- people know it quite well
 yeah okay so yeah so i have some other candidates um it's on first page at the bottom uh i also put pulp fiction uh the silence of the lambs and i also   well sort of included la vita e bella but i know we're an engish movie club so i guess it's um   it's a bit out of purpose   but it
 oh it's uh it's about again about the camps and the second world war so it's about uh a family of italians which uh g- arrives into a a death camp and in fact it's treated in a more or less humorous mode so um the father tries to hide from i- from his boy that they are in a death camp and it's this very strange um well not really humor but relation between the uh how
 well the boy gets saved but the father dies yeah so i don't know i- it created some controversies i think because people said you shouldn't do any form of humor related to the camps but it's very very moving so i think it's anyway um italian so
 yep yeah
 okay uh denis
 haven't seen it but uh i heard it's very funny and i've seen some other films by by the coen brothers
 yeah which is in your table
 um the last one was the one with catherine zeta jones uh
 crue- crue-
 yeah something about cruelty or very funny
 a movie or a novel
 no but they say that raymond chandler wrote the novel you see it's the the last but one paragraph on your second page
 i think so
 um
 um
 y- you wrote the paragraph on the poster
  
 okay   could be edited a bit  
 yeah yeah there are two lebowskis in the film
 uhhuh
 yeah there should be a reference there
 yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah it's probably a bit dark for a poster but otherwise it's very nice
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh  
 oh okay it's a dream
  
   okay sounds a bit crazy
 yeah
 hmm
 uhhuh
 yeah
 i like it because it's not so dark so the images are a bit um brighter
  
 yeah yeah
 yeah uhhuh
 yeah
 uhhuh
 wh- what about a brighter background because this one i don't know how it would show on a wall or something like this it doesn't really catch your attention
 okay
 yeah
 um
 yeah okay
 yeah no the content was very good in the second one th-
 yeah all this information is very good
 uhhuh
 oh or just one of them
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 oh yeah w-
 i i would suggest
 if it's not too long maybe each of us could nominate one or two movies we make a list and then we vote
 what do you think
 so who wants so mirek what do you nominate
 you are okay
 in the nominees okay another nominee
 okay agnes usual suspects
 uhhuh
 yeah well you can nominate one or two so that we or whatever um i would nominate well okay my candidate saving private ryan
 and uh i'm happy with your nominations too uh i would nominate also pulp fiction because it's a very good movie
 um denis so your yours is already nominated but you want
 yeah
 okay so it's already on the list
 uhhuh
 yeah if you want
 so
 so we have uh seven candidates um if you have a good short term memory that should be okay   yeah so uh big lebowski usual suspects saving private ryan pulp fiction american beauty schindler's list and silence of the lambs so now let's vote should we vote just for one film or should each of us say give
 okay
 so big lebowski
 alright
 uh you can write on your paper maybe
 and saving private ryan
 so
 yeah pulp fiction yeah okay so each of us chooses one to eliminate
 okay denis
 okay i will just remove it this way um um
 i would remove schindler's list because it's too sad
 well it's not very good reason but  
 oh too bad
  
 no no   well i mean leave someth-   okay so we're left with the big lebowski usual suspects saving private ryan and american beauty
 okay so let's vote just simply for one for the moment
 so i would vote for american beauty because i haven't seen it  
   um so mirek big lebowski agnes denis
   uh
   yeah you can choose
 y- you're the president maybe after all uh
   okay yeah i think i'm quite fine
 is it a b- yeah i think at least it's funny and uh that's nice okay
 so
 decision
 uhhuh
 that's your fault mirek  
 no no no i mean yeah it's you voted for it but i'm quite happy with it i haven't seen it
 well beginning of may i guess to choose the film for may is that
 yeah the fifth is um ascension what's that going up to the sky
 yeah we can do it like the tuesday before the ascensions and that's may third
 so yeah so thanks for the posters actually denis they are very nice
 okay  
 see you on what april twenty sixth or what's the um twenty ninth okay
 hello  
 no i haven't
 thank you
 uhhuh
 okay i have a powerpoint presentation and uh it's about there are some reviews of the of the i think like seven movies
 no i haven't
  
 hmm
 uhhuh
 uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh
 nineties yeah
 so plenty of awards we we could say  
 of all the movies yeah yeah
 it's still good actually  
 by the users
  
 so it's definitely just the average of the rating and okay th- the number of the votes is there just for the information so that you know how how reliable yeah
 yes
 um
 okay
 okay then you yeah then yes yes yes yes sure
  
  
 uhhuh
   yeah  
 uhhuh uhhuh
 and what is the second movie
 yeah sixth sen-
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh  
 okay now you can go to to my slides but actually what i pre- what i have prepared is just a kind of a review of fo- uh se- six or seven movies if you ca- can go to the second slide
 yes basically seven movies and it's uh it's uh uh top movies uh based on the uh on the ra- ranking and a- and awards awards um you see the the names of the movies on the on the on the wall so um we can perhaps go through all of them and we can little bit discuss so i i i have n- i didn't see all of them actually so it's just we should probably select one of these because i think uh these are really good movies and uh okay we will see so if you can go through uh   okay so this is the first movie and uh it's it's m- it's more like a drama uh it's uh it's uh very uh high ranked and actually you have a a nicer list because uh we can even see the number of the votes so what is the number of the people
 finally i found actually your table much better than my   than my presentation because perhaps here we can we can really see i mean
 what is the ranking we ha- didn't have the plot yeah
 yeah who has seen this movie   because then perhaps someone can give some some comment
 uhhuh
 yeah it's this one it's the one that is on the on the wall it's projected yeah
 so i ge- okay so no one of us saw this movie so in that case perhaps it's it's little bit danger to select that movie for the for the
 s- play so uh schindler's list who saw this
 i saw it and i think this on is re- um this one is really nice it's uh you know all a- all of you knows the the story so
 uh it's quite hi- it's quite high ranked so i think uh it's not a bad movie i'm uh thinking whether there was some good occasion uh something what has happened recently there was something like a celebration of the
 fifty years after the war or something recently no
 no that's
 sixty yeah   s- it can't be fifty sure
 yeah so
 uhhuh
 that's true
  
 yes yes yes yes
 um but even here i wouldn't uh uh say that the that th- this style is representative of the nineties right so  
 um
 okay but uh anyway i think it's it's really a good movie i like it when i saw it and uh okay
 it's one of the candidates i defini- yeah steven spielberg is really quite a good so i director so i i would say we we could think about it so i would keep it as a candidate at least
 that's the second one
 um no   i think we can just skip this slide
 uh yeah
 it's
 that's strange what is the rating
 perhaps it has changed
 it's higher
 it gets updated
 yes yes and i did it i did it on wednesday
 yes
 uhhuh so it probably has changed so um
 it becomes more popular no po- uh   yeah yeah yeah  
 uh schindler's list i saw it i saw it
 uhhuh
  
  
 okay pulp fiction uh i think it's again quite uh hi- high ranked uh but from my perspective everyone already saw it who was interested in that movie he saw it wh- who is not interested in that movie he he didn't see it and he uh wouldn't uh like to see it in the in our movie club so i think we should uh we should just leave skip it out and leave it out i i wouldn't think about this as a candidate even if it's a good movie but i don't know i think it's
 yes yes there was ple- i i think there was a plenty of loops actually plenty of
 i fully agree that you can see this movie three times perhaps three times and for the fourth time see you still discover something new but uh on the other hand i have the impression it's really it's uh you know every everyone saw it it's it's quite well known uh it woul- it wou- i
 yeah
 me neither
 um so what do you think i i wouldn't think about this as a candidate because it seems to me it's
 uhhuh
 vote that's the best yeah yeah
 when going through we c- we could just eliminate okay so we are not going to eliminate this one   uh goodfellas i didn't see it
 no   but you can read the comment from the users uh that's the that's the last uh bullet point and it says uh simply a masterpiece uh and it's uh scorsese's last really great movie to date
 mafia yes
 i can't recognize them from the picture   the picture is not very good quality
  
  
  
 and it's a movie from nineties the one that you saw that you mentioned
 yeah
 no
 silence of the lambs uh
 should i tell something more godfather of all thrillers that's what it what it says on the   what some uh user says uh so okay it's a little bit horror so i think it's quite it's uh it's uh  
 it's definitely not for kids uh but uh if the kids are not visitors of our cinema why not
 it
 one have to rethink when when when you are watching this movie you have to think and it's uh scaring uh why not
 uhhuh uhhuh
 so the f  b  i  agent is assigned to to help uh find a a missing woman and uh save her f- uh her from a psychopathic killer with the help of another killer
 yeah
 he's in prison yes
 he's a really psychotic man
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
  
 anthony
 no but he plays it really good anthony hop- hopkins he really plays it very good very good yeah  
 so
  
  
 i've i've see- i've seen it but i can't really remember exactly the all the details
 uh
 it's a long time ago it's from ninety one
 ninety one yeah
 so and i saw it when i was like twelve or thirteen   so perhaps it would be
 yeah could you go to the next slide
 yeah it's here and that's actually my last slide so um
 i don't know because it nicely f-   i i was thinking perhaps we are not able to go through more of them
 uh
 so american beauty so i can perhaps read a little bit the user comment if you want or uh yeah you can read the plot outline on the on the on the projector but it's basically deep wonderful and penetrating movie extraordinary uh irony and the p- and the psychological drama about american life
  
 poetic  
 okay the way of filming perhaps but uh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah
 and it's my last slide so uh yes yes yes and i think okay why not
 it seems to me that perhaps that schindler okay definitely schindler schindler's list is perhaps more serious topic for sure but um well it depends it depends what we want do we want that people are more like uh relaxed in our in our cinema or are more interested in some particular things
 um what do you think i mean what should we how we should uh
 what should be the influence how we are influencing the people in the cinema
 um
 what do we want
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 hmm
 uhhuh
 maybe can i ask you for the for the list of movies
 this one and the
 denis denis could you give me the the list of the to- uh top fifty yeah but you have your own copy then   okay good thank you
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
  
 that's the i i i saw it and i d- i'm trying to remember the beginning that's the normandy landing okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that was really horrible
 yeah
 uhhuh
 uhhuh uhhuh
   no not at all
 uhhuh
 because people start to complain that uh   that w- there was a problem with a t  v  when they were broadcasting the movie on the t  v  uh  
 that's an interesting point interesting point  
 yeah but in the end you can ref- yes
 no
 uhhuh
 by the way did he fied dinally uh f- fi-   died finally or not
 uh the private ryan yeah
 th- they i remember i remember they found him but ah okay yes yes yes
 because i remember  
 uhhuh
 because i remember that th- in the end of the movie they are trying to defend some bridge or something and there's quite heavy shooting and uh finally it's actually john miller who die okay okay
 it's not the private ryan
 uhhuh
 perhaps it was a g- uh this uh tom hanks yeah
 oh yeah yeah
 if he would kill him he wouldn't die wow tom hanks wouldn't die
 i've seen it i've seen it
 out of time
 uhhuh
  
 what is the movie about the la vita e bella
 ah ha
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh uhhuh
 how it end up what is the what is the ending of the movie
 uhhuh uhhuh
  
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 that's actually the third movie about the second war schindler's list a p- uh saving private ryan and la vita e bella
 uhhuh
 just partially i think
 uhhuh
  
 uhhuh
 uhhuh uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh why the movie is called the big lebowski why the big uh lebowski is his uh family name right but why it's called the big
 okay and why the big lebowski it's the it's the second one or  
 uhhuh ah okay okay uhhuh
  
 uhhuh uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 i think this is not bad because they say something little bit about our uh movie club and uh yeah the big lebowski it's clear that it's a movie and uh i guess the people can remember that it was a movie at least even if they haven't see it
 cd cover  
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
  
 yeah but i   on the contrary i would say there is too many colors and uh it's difficult to read and uh
 yeah that would be the best
  
  
 yeah all this information and put into the first one uhhuh
 if if they fit there if they fit there you will see
 uhhuh  
 so big lebowski
 uhhuh okay good idea
 so i'm really convinced by the big lebowski   i yes yeah i i would like to uh yeah at least to have it uh in the
 in the nominees exactly and uh i'm trying to remember all of them
 uhhuh uhhuh
 and then i'm still hesitating between the schindler's list and the s- uh silence of the lambs  
 may i nominate uh these all these three movies big lebowski schindler's list and the silence of the lambs
 uhhuh
  
 so eliminate first eliminate first uhhuh
 i'm sorry could you go t- uh uh uh once again through uh the list of the movies because i don't or i- is it possible to put them on the on the on the uh whiteboard
 okay okay so the schindler's list the usual suspects uh silence of the lambs uh big lebowski okay
 saving private ryan
 one two
 pulp fiction okay
 i have six i have six how many   okay we   american beauty
  
 okay
  
 yeah and i would eliminate
 yeah and i would eliminate pulp fiction actually as well if so
 another one because it   because it would be saving private ryan
 um
 i vote for big lebowski
 make a decision  
  
 already ready yeah  
 so
 so it's going to to be big lebowski
 okay
  
 no no no no no i i like it i like it
 okay beginning of may but there are there is plenty of holidays at the beginning of may no
 ascension
 uhhuh okay okay no problem
 good
 twenty nine
 really looking forward i want to see it  
 hi
 so i don't know if you all received the the a- agenda for this meeting do you no
 here it is
 so um   um the goal for today are um we have two goals uh first is to decide a movie for uh the next projection for our movie club as you know uh so it's for the last friday of this month of april as you probably remember the movie already projected were uh lawrence of arabia and apocalypse now in february and amadeus from milos forman in march
   so um the question that is open is are we going to select a movie from the nineties and which movie so that's the first goal decide for a movie to be projected and second goal is to uh discuss for an ad- advertising poster um for our um   uh club because we noticed that n- last time not enough people came to the projection
 so that's it um wh- who wants to start to
 so i guess you all prepared some documents for the um selection of movie
 okay
 okay
 yeah i have also uh a piece of paper with uh my favorite movie
   okay so
 presentation yeah okay a- agnes we can start with you
 okay here it is
 i passed this one
 which which one was it again the guy who was controlling i don't remember i have seen the movie twice but uh
 it's the bald guy the
   no no   okay  
 yeah it's a bit more commercial that one first one
 um
 r  is what uh in
 okay
 restricted
 but wait i i have the top ten from the nineties no the top fifty and it's fourth
 oh sorry sorry yep yeah yeah
 from yeah yeah yeah
 but but sixteenth in top two hundred fifty it's what two uh all all days all time
 okay
 but those rating are more like uh it's the number of votes no
 votes and u-
 yep
  
 and rating
 yep
 yeah yeah
 yep
 okay yep
 ah now i remember
 yep
 actually there is one guy who is the at the police station and they ask him to tell the story yeah yeah
   both movies are quite similar in some way because the last sentence is uh totally contradictory to the whole movie it's uh
 yeah the last sentence from the movie
 yeah
 okay you have a last slide or no
 okay
 okay
   yeah one hundred f- w- uh one hundred forty thousand
  
 no we don't have the plot of the of the movie and uh
 okay but maybe we can wh- who has seen this movie
 i uh
 i think i i i've seen it actually but
 i have no idea
 it it's in uh jail right it taking yeah
 i don't remember well this movie
 yep
 okay okay
 okay so um
 yep so let's
  
 yeah i've seen it also
 sixty s- sixty years
 yep yep that's right yeah
 but then it's not representative of the nineties it's more a movie about the story of uh the horror of the uh endured by the jewish during the second world war
   yeah right
  
 yeah yeah
 okay and steven steven spielberg is uh
 okay
 okay the usual suspect do we want to say something again about it or
 how come it's coming third
 on your list
 it's forth on agnes's uh and on my list but it's okay ah you j- you selected some movies no you didn't take the six first
 and me on tuesday probably
   okay do we have something to add on this movie or
 okay
 yep
 yep
 that's why you are in the movie club to see more movies  
 why not it's quite representative of the nineties i think and the structure of the movie is interesting
 i i think the the first scene is actually the same scene as the last scene no there is a kind of loop in this movie
 yep
 yeah yeah i agree also yeah
 you've you've seen it okay
 and the soundtrack is uh is gorgeous also no you don't the soundtrack
 no
 yeah yeah
 w- w- we vote at the end or you want to
 okay
 no
 ah it's scorsese's  
 it's uh yeah again a movie about uh on mafia no
 with uh robert de niro and who are the o- two other guys i cannot
 ah joe pesci yeah on the r- on the right you mean yeah
  
 it's the exact same actors who played in um another mafia movie that i cannot rememb- les affranchis it was the name in french no
 about uh mafia   uh it that's why i tha- that's why i didn't go to see this one it's quite i- it seems to me they're all about the same subject and the same i don't know
 probably yeah
 okay n- nobody's seen it so
   okay
  
 so it's about a psychopathic killer
 and
 what was it again the plot i mea- the
 he he's in jail and he's still killing
 ah okay yeah yeah  
 yep
 who's playing the ps- psychopath again i don't
 yeah
 okay yeah
 okay
 no i've seen it actually twice i think  
 that's it's it's probably begin-
 ninety one
 yep  
 okay american beauty w- w- was coming next seven was quite quite nice actually
 ah it's actually there
 why you choose you choose seven movie
 okay
 yeah it's definitely about american life
 it's it's kind of crude the critique but uh on the other way it's quite poetic it's uh yeah
 yeah you know with the the way of filming and um i don't know i found it pretty
 no it's q- it's quite in- interesting
 so yeah
 well it depends
 ah no it's it's not violent at all but more it's more the cr- the cr- the critique that is quite crude because all the people in this movie are are uh psychopath in their own way
 but they are normal people then
 yeah
 actually there is this it's uh uh what a fifty years old man that quit his job and fall in love with um the best friend of his daughter
   yeah it's it's good movie
 okay
 you have seen it mirek
 i think we w- want them to to see movies that they won't see oth- otherwise but i'm not sure then it's quite popular the movie we selected so
 if they are in the top fifty they are quite mainstream but uh
 uh i think there is the
 there are chinese movies english movies
 it's it's quite a lot for kieslowski actually i was surprised to s- yeah yeah
 and festen also is uh is quite high uh i i don't know if you've seen this one it's the celebration i think it's uh uh movie from a swedish guy
 danish dogma movies yeah lars von trier
 yeah
 okay can we
 discuss about your document maybe
 yep
 okay
 okay
  
 yeah sure
 yep
 yeah it's quite horrible actually
 yeah
 mirek you didn't see it
 yeah
 but it's it's a piece of art because he used something like one hundred camera to film that or
 yep
 yeah it's quite s- yeah
 yeah it is there is two there are two versions i think and but w- but we yeah we projected the longer one so
 how many times uh spielberg received the best uh director oscar
 not for the schin- schindler's list or for
 for e  t 
 he won f- he won the um
 no he won f- for e  t  he won the um cannes uh what is uh palme d'or
 yeah
 that was very interesting to read yeah
 but then they uh i read that they they w- where was it th- they turned back to yeah
  
 and then then there is this uh there is an hero i mean it's uh or a non hero and in all the other stu- stories the in the previous movies there were an he- an hero lawrence of arabia uh amadeus apocalypse now it's also non hero i think but uh but here i don't remember it's actually the tom hanks the hero or it's
 he's private ryan tom hanks no he's not he's trying to find him
 yeah yeah
 okay
 at the end to tell you the truth i didn't like so much the movie because it was quite moralistic because there were a guy who was who didn't kill german because he was quite nonviolent and because he didn't kill this german the german killed i don't know uh maybe um
 yep
 and it was like if he had killed the um
 because he- e- yeah
  
 yeah
 i have
 yeah
 yeah we're running um
  
 but it was in english no
 yep so i have uh a quite different movie to propose you i don't know uh it's f- called the big lebowski from um uh joel coen actually they are brothers you probably know them i don't know how many of you have seen this movie
 no
 yeah they made uh fargo which is in the list
 and uh
 uh cr- uh cruel intentions or something like that i think or
 okay so i don't know how i'm going to sell you this movie because actually the plot is impossible to make because it's um actually it's inspired from a movie called the big sleep and um
 uh it's actually the t- where i've seen that in a it's uh a movie from raymond chandler the big sleep it's uh
 ah okay
 yeah yeah yeah so it's it's uh it's a novel okay
 but uh then the story goes that while that film was in production and director okay okay you're right it was a book okay so it's about a a g- a guy who called the d- the dude i don't know you pronounce it and uh he's actually uh smoking pot and doing nothing just um   he's living in l  a  it's uh it's a typical typical fellow from the from the suburb and he has some friends uh typical friends one one is uh an old guy from coming back from vietnam obsessed by vietnam um another guy who is never speaking and they all play together uh bowling
 and um   the casting is very interesting there is um okay actually i wanted to propose you some posters related to this movie uh maybe it w- maybe it's going to open the discussion on on posters as well
 so actually here you on this the first poster you can see the actors from the movie i don't know if you know some of them so jeff bridges at the top uh goodman is the second one the b- the big guy then turturro and uh uh the last one is buscemi and i don't remember the name of the girl
 yeah julianne moore
 uh i i took it from i don't know where so uh
 actu-
 actually i'm not going to sp- to describe much more the big lebowski but uh it's quite hard to describe it's uh it's it's a journey about this guy but it's it's a movie quite surrealistic i mean there are some part that are like coming from dreams and uh
 yeah it's his family name and uh actually jeffrey lebowski and he's he's the there is a a story with another lebowski that yeah
 and uh
   i i i don't remember maybe it's just uh uh because of the big sleep there is uh
 i don't know a reference so it's a kind of it's like american beauty in some way it's even worse we see worse people so it's kind of uh an ethnographic movie i would say but uh and it's a modern hero it's it's quite fun and the casting is is marvelous so that is that's it for this movie and um   i just wanted to go to the design of the poster actually
 because
 yeah
 yep
 the idea is is also to discuss the content shall we put a summary of the movie or the plot and w- what kind of information do we want so that's the first poster
 there is alo um this poster quite dark also
 uh so y- y- i don't know if you you cannot really see but uh um there is the the pricing information so we said that one movie is eight francs and three movies eighteen francs and we can have annual subscrip- subscription of sixty francs
 uh i wanted to say some information to involve people on in the committee as well if they want to take part to the committee to select movies
   and uh what else
 s- some
 yeah actually the idea was to s- yeah there is at the bottom the a scene from one of these dream of the big lebowski
 and uh the the first part is actually y- you see a cowboy and the the hero the jeffrey lebowski the dude and the cowboy it's actually at the beginning of the movie the c- the cowboy introduce the story and he's coming back at the end of the story and he's e- explaining what kind of movie uh you are going to to see  
 and last posters
 so same principle but i w- i don't know i w- i was thinking of adding some some um cita- quotations of uh well known directors
 and uh
  
  
 yeah
 okay
 okay
 okay i see
 and yeah
 okay i see what i wanted is more or less to know the content of the movie uh what y- you want to have on the poster
 because we di- we
 okay on that one
 okay
 okay great so i think now we have to decide for a movie
 and um
 yep
 so
 yep i th-
  
 i would nominate uh
 american beauty as well
 and um
 and i would be okay with saving private ryan it's it's it can
  
 or we can eliminate first one one movie each and then we s- and then we select
  
 okay
 okay
 yeah that's a bit cruel but uh that's i think a good way
 me i would remove silence of the lambs because i think it's too violent
  
 and you have a reason for it or   okay
 maybe you can eliminate another one you can no  
 w-
  
 agnes you v-  
 o-
 okay now i have the if we want okay if we want to take a okay
 okay so i'll go with the big lebowski since the posters are already ready
 yeah i think
 okay
 so we have other anyway so can we decide for uh a next meeting maybe
 okay
 okay o- or we'll decide after the projection of the movie the date it's okay
 okay okay
 you're welcome
 okay thank you
 and uh see you at the projection
 no twenty ninth
 okay
  
 are you going to take the minutes
 good
 hello
 um i don't do you have an extra copy thanks
 okay
  
 uhhuh
 sure
   okay so the previous movies that we've done this year were lawrence of arabia apop- apocalypse now and amadeus which were all historical serious dramatic and somewhat actiony movies so for this month i propose doing something different preferably something set in the present um something maybe dramatic but slightly less serious so what i'd propose is actually a thriller or a mystery and while these days people are so jaded by general movies that they tend not to be surprised by the endings in mysteries some movies in the nineties did actually have twists that people came out saying never saw that coming i didn't know that that was going to happen
 and so what i'm going to do is present you two of those movies and before anyone says that well if you know th- how the movie ends you're not going to want to see it again that's not necessarily the case because a lot of people like to re watch movies um to see where the clues were what they missed things they didn't pay attention to the first time around um so if you can go to the next slide what i'd propose is either the usual suspects or the sixth sense um the usual suspects is slightly less mainstream um is has a fairly large cast notably kevin spacey gabriel byrne um and it was directed by bryan singer it's one of his earlier movies i think it was written by quist- christopher mcquarrie
 um and according to rolling stone it's the freshest funniest and scariest crime thril- thriller to come along since pulp fiction uh the sixth sense on the other hand is a more commercial movie with its famous line i see dead people um it was written and directed by m  night uh shyamalan and stars bruce willis haley joel osment and toni collette and it's about a little boy who sees dead people and i- he sees a child psychologist to try to get him to understand why he sees the dead people what it means
 now that you've given away the twist yes   um
 yeah
   send your complaints to rolling stone   so on the next couple of slides i'll just go through some of um more detailed stuff that we might need for administrative purposes um the length for the usual suspects um is a hundred and five minutes uh as you can s- well as andrei already said it's n- nineteen ninety five it has an r  rating which means that at least in the in north america it was not recommended for people under eighteen because it's fairly violent but not so violent as other movies um plot outline uh five villains in new york are rounded up by the police in an unconventional manner that worries them after release they get together for a spot of revenge but someone else is controlling events and the big mystery of the movie is who's controlling the events
 um it got an eight point seven out of ten user rating on the internet movie database it's sixteenth in the top two hundred and fifty movies of all time forth in denis's list of the top movies of the nineteen nineties which i think was also taken from i  m  d  b  um it won several academy awards including best supporting actor and best writing um best film for the british equivalent of the academy awards it was nominated for a cesar for best foreign film so it got a fair bit of recognition despite not being
 um a very mainstream high budget movie or maybe because it wasn't a mainstream high budget movie
 i don't think a lot of people have seen it in fact other than
   you haven't seen it you haven't seen it you've seen it
 and don't think a lot of people have seen it it's not a very very well known movie what
 is it
 see
 really
 that surprises me i always got the impression that it was
 yeah well it's a good movie
 yeah
 yeah
 so but i think the main thing is it's got a good twist at the end and
 it's it's an interesting movie to watch
 um so if you go to the next slide more or less the same thing for the sixth sense it's slightly newer nineteen ninety nine more or less the same amount of time it has a lower rating because it's less violent but it depends what audience we are going to have at the showings
 it has it's scary and i think it has some sort of slight violence but
 yeah but they're not violently dead
 it's it's morbid and it's creepy but it's not violent as in people being sliced in half or anything like that um   um it's nineteenth in the top movies of the nineties hundred first in the top two hundred fifty it was nominated for a lot of awards it didn't win
 as many might have won more sort of minor awards but at least the academy awards it was nominated for five of them um but didn't win nevertheless still a good movie still a good twist at the end which denis already gave away  
   good um so those would be my two choices
 let it's a sort of different style from the other movies we've seen and they have a twist so it's not your general movie where you just kind of sit through it and go oh okay get up and leave it's at least out of those two movies i came out thinking oh cool okay
 yeah but
 i mean that's a good thing right
 yes
 yeah
 which is a good marketing ploy if you think about it  
 yeah bruce willis is and the kid is really good who plays the the main character
 yeah yeah
 same guy  
 no
 i've heard a lot of really good things about it but
 uhhuh
 yeah i think it's about three hours long something like that
 and it's a heavy movie i it's emotional it's
 i think it did
 either for director if not for best picture
 yeah
 um
 yeah i've seen it
 yeah yeah that was his comeback movie yeah
 yeah
 it's uma thurman yeah
 uh maybe because i  m  d  b  is updated daily so if it happens that people had voted for it
 uhhuh
 have you
 but it is this movie  
 ah okay
 okay
  
 yeah
 yeah i wouldn't be surprised
 no it's later than that isn't it
 yeah
  
 i don't know but it was a good performance creepy
 yeah
 i think so yeah
 when did it come out
 yeah
   as are we all  
 yeah me too
 i don't think i've seen it since then
 ah  
 no on the seco- uh second one
 yeah
  
 it wasn't that good but i think it was almost more disgusting in a way
 there were some scenes in it where normally i don't get queasy watching movies but that was just too much
 it might be a little bit too violent
 for i don't know
 yeah
 that's a good movie
   yeah it's kevin spacey
   quite possibly yeah
 yeah
 theoretically yeah
  
 yeah
   yeah  
 morgan freeman
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 well let's go through the other suggestions
 i do
 yeah
 uhhuh
 up close
 yeah
 it's very different i don't think you can compare them
 also sets the mood a little bit
 darker and
 yeah but you'd get a different impression if you had bright blue sky and bright sunshine behind it
 uhhuh
 yeah he's private ryan
 well
 they're being sent to the front behind enemy lines to retrieve one soldier only because all of his other brothers died
 most of them get killed don't they yeah
 yeah
 um um
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah
   i tried to  
 uhhuh
  
 uhhuh
  
 uhhuh
 or is that the other lebowski
 oh okay
  
  
 buscemi yeah
 really
  
 uhhuh yeah
 i think it looks too much like a c  d  cover though
 i like the layout of the first one and the content of this one
 it looks like two different posters though
 it's hard to read
 the paragraph i think was a little bit long
 i would   and content of the second one
 yeah
 yeah like what you have there
 and then maybe replace the paragraph that you had on the first poster with either shorter sort of descriptions not even of the whole plot but just descriptions of the movie or because i think that paragraph is too long people don't r- generally just stand there and then read the whole thing
 uhhuh
  
  
 it's here forty eight
 i hope more people have seen it  
 uhhuh
  
 um i'd go for sixth sense just because it's different from all the other ones and
 maybe shawshank redemption just because we haven't seen it
 uhhuh
 yeah
  
  
 okay um
   okay
 okay um
   so i'll
 i'll give two to american beauty and
 um
 one to the big lebowski
 okay so it's pretty clear
 american beauty
 well you can keep the format i mean th- you didn't have that many graphics in the first one  
 yeah
 okay
 yes but of the wrong movie   that's the real twist
 no she's not
 no it's who is it annette bening who's the m- the main character the well the main female character the mother
 when do you want these images by
 just quickly
 day after tomorrow
 two thousands
 third isn't it
 monday may third
 we can ask people casually sort of what genre of movie they want or
 start again
 or go back to the fifties
   okay
 american beauty
 it's just that i need uh some some white paper
 uh yes
 um hello
 yes i did
 um
 ah
 no but we're the clubbers but
 agnes uh i was just wondering uh i see uh i have here denis's table and when they say that it's the freshest whatever since pulp fiction well that's probably not a very long time because pulp fiction is ninety four and usual suspects is ninety five   okay   yeah
  
  
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 i haven't seen it
 really
 oh
 it's it's hard to tell so that's your impression yeah that's mine but uh
 yeah how many people voted for it yeah that's true
 uhhuh
 yeah
 isn't violent at all in fact or it's more like scary or
 uhhuh
 scary or yeah uhhuh creepy or
  
 uhhuh
 have you seen it
 okay
 uhhuh
 okay
 ah
 if we show it twice
  
 okay so is bruce willis the child psychologist ah great
 uhhuh
 yeah it's the guy who then played in uh artificial intelligence or something like this uhhuh
   great
 um
 uh me neither
 i thi-
 so uh i was told that in french it was called uh les evadees
 yeah
 should we should we believe this
  
 uhhuh
 yeah maybe even best picture yeah uhhuh
 but yeah indeed it's maybe too sad and too yeah too poignant for
 well
  
 uhhuh
 yeah i've seen it too yeah it's it's very good and it's a bit violent but it's also quite funny i think
 it's a
 uhhuh
 yeah
 the boxer
 pardon
 yeah as the boxer
 uh uma thurman
  
  
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah it's strange with so many votes that they can p- shift i mean statistically speaking it's strange  
  
 uhhuh
 wow
 um
 but it was that movie okay
  
  
 uhhuh
 okay  
 not really in favor of this but
 ah
  
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
  
 yeah i think yeah when yeah i saw this movie some time ago and yeah she looked quite young i thought
 ninety one
  
  
 uhhuh
  
 okay oh yeah i've seen it yeah yeah it's a good movie i um i don't know maybe too well known but since it's fifteen years old maybe people would li-
 yeah
 uhhuh
 oh again
  
 uhhuh
 i see
 s- uhhuh uhhuh
 ah that's the girl who is represented on the the picture  
 you recognize her belly  
 uh
 oh so you recognize the rose
  
 uhhuh
 yeah
 yeah that's true
 yeah but didn't i mean i see this name of the the director on the slide but i don't really know him frank darabont  
 never heard of this guy
 uhhuh
 yeah i'm not sure yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah maybe but it's true yeah we shouldn't stick to only very highly rated movies on this table though it's a very useful table but um okay do you want me to yeah
 so yeah uh i wrote some notes on um   on saving private ryan which is my candidate if you can display them it's perfect uh do you all have a copy of them i have some paper copies uh you're welcome so actually given that more or less our theme since the beginning of the year was um history drama action and given also that well we decided to to present this month a movie from the the nineties um i thought that among these movies who look quite popular uh saving private ryan would be a very good candidate um  
 actually it's a movie i've seen have you seen it before okay so you've all seen it so maybe everyone has seen it i'm not very sure um but i think it's a very novel treatment of of war it's uh it's no longer the b- glorification of uh whatever combat and victory but the plot is quite different it's about saving one person who has a special special value in the in the movie um if only because his brothers actually were all killed so uh the government believes that they should save at least one person from the family and saving means actually removing from the the front if you if re- if you remember the plot
 so in fact this guy the private ryan is not at all the main actor the the main a- well the main character is uh played by tom hanks and it's actually you can see his picture on the second page of my my notes uh captain john miller so he is sent with this rather strange mission which is not a combat mission but they uh they want just to to get this guy back which is in fact this guy is i think behind enemy lines or something like this so it happens in in europe just after the the normandy landing and it's very very striking the way they they filmed all the the combat scenes and uh it's it's very dramatic it's uh it's not you know like in the movies from the fifties or the sixties where people just fall and die anonymously but here they well you see everything and you see how many people die on that day it's actually
 well it's very strange you could s- ask this for any sad movie did you enjoy it well i didn't really enjoy to see bad things but uh i think it was satisfying to see that well how dramatic things are yeah exactly yeah i- it's very moving i it's true it's not very it's not very well happy i don't know how it would compare with apocalypse now if it's darker or maybe
 yeah so yeah so i think this would continue a bit our our theme so the the movie is ranked quite high if i if i refer back to your table it's number uh what actually um fourteen quite a lot of votes so um also one of the the mainstream movies um on the second page uh of my notes i   well i quoted some uh well some facts about the movie that i found interesting we we could use them for either a poster or uh or a presentation um especially i enjoyed the story about the the color saturation it's true that the movie is not really black and white uh but uh the colors are gray ish dark ish it it prov- it makes a very moving effect
 yeah i think also to show the um yeah i think it's the reference to history and also this dark yeah the mood and uh things are actually well most of the things are quite gray you know the uniforms weapons things and things like that
 uhhuh
 exactly
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 well i think matt damon is the guy who must be saved if i remember well and in fact the die
 well yeah the people didn't understand why they should save one person
 so and they are quite resentful because they   i mean they feel they should fight they shouldn't just go there and uh just get someone and get back and in fact some of them d- get killed for this guy actually most of them yeah i think so
 so
 yeah yeah it's a very i think some people compare it with uh whatever christian message or i don't know but um i think it's quite quite universal and it's uh i think it's a modern very modern
 well this uh value of one individual it looks like a christian message you know the value of one is compared to others i i don't know i th- i think i heard this at that point but maybe i'm just wrong so yeah i   i think it would make a coherent choice it's probably a bit long and we might want something that is lighter and funnier but uh if we want to keep this this idea of history and conflict and also to show some some kind of modern treatment of it it it would make for a good choice but if you see in my notes at the bottom of the first page i put some other candidate movies
 uh la vita e bella is an italian one but it's also about history and it happens at t- the same period as schindler's list and i also quoted pulp fiction and silence of the lambs um a bit more remote from the themes but quite well known movies and enjoyable i would say   so do you have any questions about this or should we just move to the next candidate maybe
 okay
 it's just below the table so since we all refer to the table
  
 uhhuh
 yeah no i think the summary is i- is quite good and especially i think it uh well um when you read it you just want to go to see the movie i think it looks funny for me i haven't seen the movie but uh the summary looks funny
  
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
  
   uhhuh
 actually who are the two characters on the the p- the poster on the on the image that
 uhhuh
 and w- and which one is the big lebowski on the picture
 okay so the guy with the glasses
 the vietnam guy
  
 hmm
  
 well sort of
 oh
 uhhuh
 oh
 yeah you cannot read it very well because
 um
 uhhuh yeah the text on this one is very good
 oh because it's square
 uhhuh
 yeah i don't like the black one the f- the first poster is i think much uh much too dark
 no that's nice
 yeah
 yeah
 uhhuh yeah maybe two or three sentences because i guess they won't stop in front of the poster
 yep
 so layout of the first one
 and colors of the third one
  
 yeah uhhuh
 uhhuh
 oh okay
 so the woman on the second picture that's julianne moore or oh
 ah
   interesting so it's not really violent or i mean the movie is quite for general audiences okay
 okay
 huh
 well at least voted for it
  
 um
   yeah
 yeah let's nominate first
 and then we vote we choose from the list
 uhhuh
 well i'll nominate the one i proposed saving private ryan so history war drem- drama and i haven't seen it but i would like to see it and i think american beauty
 if you if you think that our series okay it's not about america but uh still apocalypse well yeah it's about countries   so agnes denis
 so denis are you happy with our choices or would you like to add something
 uhhuh
 okay
 so what if we voted say like for first and second choice and then we count you can give two points to one and one point to another one   would you like this strange way to vote
 um okay so uh  
 oh yeah um well it's   uh well if i nominated two and i was the only one i'll give two points to saving private ryan and one to american beauty
 you don't want to finish denis then you'd better hurry
 okay
 okay   that makes the vote more complicated um   okay so i'll give um uh b- um
 okay two to the sixth sense and one to the big lebowski
  
 i note that you didn't nominate a film so   you are sort of freer than us agnes okay oh
   american beauty four big lebowski three so you have to redo the posters uh
 um
 uhhuh
 you mean the first poster yeah
 maybe you can leave those
  
 oh leave julianne moore
 okay i'm looking forward to seeing it i haven't see it so
 um so we have to select the movie for may
 so uh we'll try a movie from the two thousands
 and we can meet at the beginning of may so i think monday is second
 no monday is third already
 um whatever
 okay
 yeah how many people we got and uh
 uhhuh
 maybe some kind of movies that spans across periods i think there is a godard with a lot of um quotations from other movies or well let's see when we
 let's cross the bridge when we get to it
 thanks see you april ni- twenty ninth american beauty
 hello
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 hmm
  
  
 i haven't see it
  
 it's a
  
 one hundred thousand one hundred and two for for voted for it yeah
 more votes yeah it's it seems to be quite popular
 uhhuh uhhuh
 okay
 uhhuh
  
 uhhuh
  
  
  
 yeah
 so my presentation is not that detailed i just uh put there seven uh highly uh ranked movies and we can just try to g- uh go very quickly through all of them just to re- remind you them and then we can perhaps consider another p- uh potential candidates
 okay so the movies that i have selected as as very good uh good ranked movies uh are uh uh are on the screen so uh shaw- the shawshank redemption schindler's list usual suspects pulp fiction goodfellas silence of the lambs and american beauty uh so perhaps we can go to the to the f- to the first movie uh the shawshank redempt- uh redemption um actually i didn't see that movie so is there someone else who have seen this movie
 okay
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 okay the plot outline says that the life of andy uh   dufresne duf- okay of andy changes when he uh he's uh convicted and jailed for the murder of his wife and the user comment says it's simply amazing the best uh film of the nineties so that's uh what it says okay we can't tell much more because basically none of us have seen it
 uhhuh yeah   so the second one is a schindler's list it's more serious movie it's from the st- uh steven spielberg and it's about the second war uh sec- second world war uh the plot outline is that the oskar schindler uh uses jews to uh start a factory in poland during the war and he witnesses the uh horrors uh endured by the jews and starts to save them user comment says a film for all to see and learn and i think it's really something what is very serious uh theme and uh yeah
 so that's a schindler's list um we can perhaps do you have some comments i i have seen it i think it's really good movie it's uh it's quite long actually i can't uh here i didn't put the the minutes but i think it's it's at least about three hours
 yeah
   no i don't know i don't know unfortunately
 but i would expect it i would expect it okay so if you can go to the
 it's a true story yeah it's it's yeah i would say that the user comment says everything a film to see and to learn
 and to remember as well yeah
 okay th- so the third one is the usual suspects so i think i i wouldn't uh i don't want to comment it again so we can just skip that because it was this this is the one already commented by agnes so let's go to the to the other one
 pulp fiction i would say that's that's like a classical movies of of nineties uh it's uh directed by quentin tarantino it's a it's a crime and drama it's a a there i- there are several s- several stories that are just mixed up during the during the movie and uh
 yeah it's a real classical movie i would say almost nowadays so
 i've seen it
 so all of us
 sure sure you can see it several times because i mean the first time you cannot catch all the details and then i- when you see it second times and third times it's
 it's big comeback yeah big comeback of john travolta yes i would say good comeback
 yes who is there huh
 yeah yeah yeah bruce willis is there as a boxer yeah
 um
 yes  
 okay so that's pulp fiction definitely should be considered uh
 uhhuh
 wow that's interesting
 how
 that may be
 yeah because yeah because i have i have uh i have th- this review on on wednesday
 okay it's  
  
 goodfellas i haven't see that movie the plot outline says that the henry hill and the his friends uh work their way uh their way up through the mob uh hierarchy and uh the user comment says it's a simply a masterpiece so and if you go to the to the to the votes there is quite a lot of people who has vote for the goodfellas sixty six thousand okay it's
   it's modern day average so it's perhaps not a bad movie i don't know i haven't see that
 you have seen it
 yeah
 uhhuh
 uhhuh and how i- was it called mafia
 uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh
 so it talks about the nineteen twen- twenties or something like o- of twenties
 uhhuh
 okay so
 mob is mafia uhhuh
 okay
   silence of the lambs that's a godfather of all thrillers i would say   fully in line with the user comments uh basically it's a it's a thriller horror and crime all together   the plot outline says that the uh clarice starling the young f  b  i  agent is assigned to help a f- to help find a mi- uh missing woman and save her from the ps- psychopathic killer with the help of another killer this another killer is actually in a jail and it's uh anthony hopkins and he really plays it a very good i would say i'm not sure whether he received some a- awards for that but it's really it's
 yes very good performance very good performance
 yeah and we can see her actually on the picture on the on the projector
 um
 uh ninety one uh ninety one uh
 so nowadays she's already fourteen years older   yeah  
 and i saw this movie when i was like uh twelve or thirteen and it was really really uh bad experience so i can't remember all the details of that movie but i would like to see it again
 i recently i saw the the uh hannibal that the seco- the sec- uh it was a third third part actually it was called hannibal i guess
 it was second one yeah
 so that's why
  
   it was really disgusting yeah
 yeah
 and the last choice that um i think it's it's not a bad movie it's uh american beauty uh
 it's basically about the about the people in america each of them is uh i would say psychotic in his uh his own way but uh normally they appear to be uh s- normal people as as we can see them ev- every day uh so and it's really it's uh the user comments say it's a deep wonderful penetrating uh film extraordinary uh irony uh in a psychological drama about american life and i can fully agree with this user comment uh
  
 he's simulati- i i i've seen this movie but i
 yeah yeah yeah
 uhhuh but then he fell in love with the the with the with the friend of uh his daughter if i remember well that's really  
 maybe  
  
 yeah yeah that's true yeah
   uhhuh
    
 and i think that's the last  
 if would like to go for something what is really serious i would definitely uh go for schindler's list and if not uh then
 hmm
 i would like to see this uh shawshank redemption because it receive i- yeah it it none of us seen this movie unfortunately but uh   as you can see from the from your from your table there is a plenty of votes it's actually i think it's a movie with highest number of the votes yeah it is
 morgan freeman yeah
 darabont
 me neither me neither
 yeah but really i would like to highlight that it's a it's a movie with highest number of the votes and the highest ranking at the same time
 so
 and actually i don't think it's it's it's that popular in europe at least because i really   you see none of us have seen it so
 yeah yeah
 yeah
  
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 but if i read your first point in the in this uh trivias
 i am just surprised because it says that all the principle actors uh underwent several days of uh cruel army training except for the man- matt damon and the reason was that they wan- uh that the that the director wanted that uh the other actors would resent him why this was uh wanted actually
 yeah
 and they didn't like it they didn't like the mission
 uhhuh uhhuh
 yeah and it okay
 yes most of them so there is actually several people dying because of one single single soldier uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 hmm
 i have no comments no no it's
 yeah but i really appreciate your table because i found this table really useful   it's a very nice summary
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 so doing nothing just uh take it easy in the life yeah
 uhhuh
 uhhuh uhhuh
  
 uhhuh
 and the one on the left is his friend
 aha yeah
  
 but this movie is is supposed to happen in uh what time i mean it's uh
 which ca-
 from the nineties and he's still uh still uh prepared from or or still as he he would come from the vietnam
 okay   there i-  
 uhhuh uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
  
 and this one is supposed to be the second lebowski
 or who
 okay okay
  
 but actually i'm i'm little bit missing th- some information about our movie club i think uh there should be some more information
 yeah i like this uhhuh
  
 uhhuh
 so perhaps we can somehow combine them
 i think there is too many colors   too many colors nowadays you know if you see some advertisements on the s- yeah but nowadays if you see some advertisement on the on the street this is typical typical uh poster i wouldn't wouldn't look at
 uhhuh
 uhhuh uhhuh
  
 exactly
  
 uhhuh uhhuh
  
 uhhuh uhhuh
 how is it actually r- ranked because i cannot see it here in your table
 i somehow can't find it
 ah forty eight
 yeah fifty thousand um um
 voted yeah  
 uhhuh
   let's nominate okay
 so i will take basically two extremes i will take schindler's list and i will take uh the big lebowski
 one of the- one of them is really just funny and from the nineties uh i mean the story is from the nineties while the second one is about the second war and is uh serious
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
  
 okay that's
 yeah but then each of us will will uh but then each of us will vote for uh our nominees so i would propose to to to vote for s- sun- uh to to give the points to the to the movies that were not nominated by you
 so then it's it's more complicated but yeah okay let's
 uhhuh okay
 sixth sense
 okay
  
 seconds
 okay and i wi- i will give one to the big lebowski and two to the uh uh shawshank redemption
 so now try to sum it up
 american beauty uh three
 uhhuh
  
 uhhuh
 but i would say these images are very nice and they are really representative perhaps
 uhhuh
  
 i'm   yeah sure sorry   sorry  
 i was sleepi-   sleeping for a while  
 uhhuh
 it should be from this period because nineties
 would be finished
 um two thousand
 uhhuh
 yeah
 whatever
 first monday of may yeah so it's after the projection and we will see what are the reactions of the people and so it makes sense that we are yes yes yes
 and perhaps we will have some new members
 um  
  
  
 american beauty finally
 okay
   yep um
 so hello everybody so uh you everybody had the a- agenda for today you received it or
 yep
 so the goal for today is to decide for a movie to project at the end of the month so for this month of of april and also discuss the content for an adver- advertising posters and um   i i will present you three des- different design we'll discuss it so first we have to decide for um a movie
 so i think we all prepared documents
 so i propose that we start with uh presentation agnes uh sent
 and actually the psychologist is dead
  
  
 yep
 um
  
 yep
 so wha- what will be your argument for projecting this movie
 yep
 it's very well known yeah
 i think yeah it's one of the most well known thriller
 yeah
 that's my impression yeah but it's it's rated four fourth in uh in the list and one hundred one hundred thousand
 seen it
 voted for it
 voted for it and i think only two other mov- uh no f- three other movies uh have uh have more votes
 but the kid is seeing dead people i mean is uh it's quite uh
 no but it's quite uh morbid you can say that yeah morbid
 yeah
   they don't remember
  
 yep
 so what was you criteria for selecting this movie or
 but then it's only at the at the end that it it becomes a good movie
 only because of the of the end
 i i've heard some people in the in the theater saying oh now we have to see it again
 but then if you asked them five minutes ago   okay
 yeah
 okay so uh i think mirek you prepared a presentation also we can have a look
  
 sorry it's control l 
 i have s- i have seen it but i don't remember it which is not good
 but the rating is very good then
  
  
 it you know if it's to uh if it received some award
 or
 probably no yeah i think also but uh
 yeah yeah
 well it's a true story also uh so
 and to remember maybe or
 yeah
 so who has seen it agnes you've seen it
 yeah
 and it's
 it's the comeback from of uh john travolta no so uh
 big comeback yeah
 bruce willis is there also
 yeah
 um
 sorry
 and what's the name of the girl on the poster
 um
 uma thurman okay
 yep
 so on the list i i brought on the docu- on my document the two movies pulp fiction and usual su- suspect are just swapped pulp fiction is actually coming before the usual suspect
 yeah tuesday it's quite surprising though but uh okay
 yeah
   actually i have seen it now i realize yeah yeah no because i thought it was like another movie but it's it's this movie actually  
 uh les in french
 i think it that one but it's very violent
 very
 it doesn't say it here but uh it's probably rated r 
 it speak about uh a guy who is not italian who is uh going up in the hierarchy of mafia
 so
 the mob so the mob is the mafia actually okay
 and jodie foster is very good as well
 she was pretty young no for
 w- w- from whe- when is the movie
 ninety one yeah
 yep
  
 but not that good no
 okay what's your opinion you have seen it
 violent and and uh scary as well um psychopathic i mean it's uh
 okay and last choice
 yep that's a good one
   and kevin spacey it's no kevin spacey he received something no
 he's actually uh quitting his job at the beginning but he's uh simulating a fight with his boss in order to to to pursue pursue to
 yeah i think yeah to sue him afterward and then
 yeah yeah
 yep
 no uh there is this rose because the she's he's imagining her taking baths with ro- roses all around and uh he's uh yeah
 exactly   okay
 um so   what will be your favou-   your preferred one on in this list
 the first one yeah probably yeah you received so- yeah
 yeah yeah
 and it's uh tim robbins and uh who is the
 the guy behi- morgan freeman yeah yeah great actors
 um yeah
 yep okay yep it tells something okay it's just a   do we want to have to display the most popular movie or or we're
 yeah
 that's right yeah
 okay andrei yeah can can you comment your
 yeah
 um yeah i w- thank you
 yep
 and you e-
 and you enjoyed that the fact the you see clo- i
 to realize how it wa- how it was exactly
 yeah it's very different yeah
   to make it like uh an historical movie or
 yeah um
   oh
 yeah
 what kind of message   sorry i'm not getting your
 okay
 yep or or we have you have
 okay so actually i don't know if uh
 y- any of you have uh read the document i prepared on the big lebowski
 it's below the table yeah i wanted
 yeah yeah yeah i wanted to say that uh it's quite open there are many choices possible but then my proposal is the big lebowski from um the two brothers uh coen coen brothers and it's a- actually joel co- coen who uh directed the movie um
 the plot is quite hard to to make but maybe you you read it al- already you understood something from the plot or
 i am  
 yeah it's it's it's a bit like the f- in my opinion like um american beauty because it's it's a funny movie but uh it critiques a lot the american society and the the the hero the the dude the um big lebowksi it's actually his name is a a kind of non hero but he's representative of the of uh a normal uh l  a  l  a  guy and uh he has a friend comi- veter- veteran from vietnam and uh another friend who is never speaking and they all are together in a bowling club where they meet and they discuss about uh everything they seems to have no job i not know we never seen i- them working yeah
 and actually he's uh taking part to a kind of um   uh
   uh s- some some killers come to his apartment uh because they think he's someone else and uh the whole story is about uh he wants to to to get some money out of this story and he's going to see the other lebowski to ask him money because he he because the killers actually uh damage some stuff in his apartment
 it's uh jeff bridges and uh john goodman john goodman you have probably seen him in in a series
   on the right the guy on the right jeff bridges
 yeah he's the one coming uh from from vietnam he's kind of uh
 he is still equipped for for war okay so uh
 it's f- a movie from the nineties actually yep
 yep yeah yeah that's a problem i'm going to actually i want to show you some posters i prepared for this movie so we actually can discuss at the same time the poster design
 so on the left you see the main characters of the movie so   the the hero at the top left then it's the guy coming back from vietnam afterward it's uh uh a guy who john turturro they are competing with him on a bowling uh contest
 and um   julianne moore and the last one is buscemi or something like that buscemi he's never speaking in the movie each time he's trying to speak the other one are are stopping him
 so it's qu-
 no he's not on the on the picture the second lebowski
   so uh my proposition was to add um the title of course some information abo- about the pricing on the right
 uh yeah but when it will be printed it will be okay i think
 ah you mean
 okay so i prepared a second one
   where th- th- th- there's there is some information at the bottom we can see that um do you know mondre- montreux english movie club uh   i said that people can contact us to to get to the committee and select movies
 so um
 okay
 but there is a th- there is a third one
 um actually i i prefer it because it's more colorful also
 but it's it can catch the eyes actually but um
 but then the problem i preferred the first one because i think it's important to have the plot of movie e- especially for uh a movie people don't n- never heard about it but uh i don't know
 okay
   okay so what do you propose what should i do for these posters in terms of content
   okay i'll try to do something but first anyway we have to select a movie so i'll put all the information and you want me to put the at the bottom all the information about the committee and the the montreux club okay
   okay
 okay
   okay
 okay so just to conti- to finish with the big lebowski it's um i think those two images are pretty representative so the on the first on on the top you see the hero with a a cowboy that i- introduces the movie and on the bottom it's uh he is he keeps dreaming in th- in this movie because uh uh the killer's um uh put it d- put it or he is drinking too much also so each time he's uh drinking he's having some dreams very very weird but interesting
   yep yeah yeah
   actually she wants him to she wants to make kids and she's using the big lebowski to have kids with him but he doesn't know so maybe he's making strange uh
 okay
  
 yeah yeah it's very very sweet and it's like a it's like a dream actually
 it's um no it is on in the table actually it's um it's coming at the end forty eight but quite a lot of people have seen it actually
 yeah
 yeah but generally you vote when you have seen the movie no
 okay so uh i think we should decide for a movie now  
 so
 maybe each of us can s- can select two movies or
 okay
   um no actually i'm happy with the choices because i really i would really push uh american beauty because i think it's uh it's an easy movie to watch and and still there are a lot of things to think afterward
 and it's representative of the nineties i think
 okay   yeah
 okay start andrei   no
   i don't want to finish i think i'm going to
   no
 yeah maybe it makes more sense yeah
 okay me i put two to american beauty
   and uh one to saving private ryan
 no big lebowski i nominate
 so do we have something
 yeah that's the only thing that's worrying me but it should be okay yeah yeah
   so you select you wanted actually me to select the this design that takes a bit more time but if you c- if all of you can send me one image i can make something on the left select one image from the movie and uh
   with a different title okay no but i'll make something
   julianne moore actually uh
 she's playing in the no in american beauty
 ah okay
   okay uh we s-
 we still have to decide for next meeting and we're all set
 uh by uh monday next monday
 i think we can meet at the same period
 yeah
 no
 first monday of may
 yep
 but then in june what are we going to do in june because we cannot make movies from ten two thousand
 yeah
 yeah maybe
 okay thank you
 so what's the movie again
 okay thank you
