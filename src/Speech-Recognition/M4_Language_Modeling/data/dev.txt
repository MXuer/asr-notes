 a laudable regard for the honor of the first proselyte has countenanced the belief the hope the wish that the ebionites or at least the nazarenes were distinguished only by their obstinate perseverance in the practice of the mosaic rites
 their churches have disappeared their books are obliterated their obscure freedom might allow a latitude of faith and the softness of their infant creed would be variously moulded by the zeal or prudence of three hundred years
 yet the most charitable criticism must refuse these sectaries any knowledge of the pure and proper divinity of christ
 his progress from infancy to youth and manhood was marked by a regular increase in stature and wisdom and after a painful agony of mind and body he expired on the cross
 he lived and died for the service of mankind but the life and death of socrates had likewise been devoted to the cause of religion and justice and although the stoic or the hero may disdain the humble virtues of jesus the tears which he shed over his friend and country may be esteemed the purest evidence of his humanity
 the son of a virgin generated by the ineffable operation of the holy spirit was a creature without example or resemblance superior in every attribute of mind and body to the children of adam
 nor could it seem strange or incredible that the first of these aeons the logos or word of god of the same substance with the father should descend upon earth to deliver the human race from vice and error and to conduct them in the paths of life and immortality
 but the prevailing doctrine of the eternity and inherent pravity of matter infected the primitive churches of the east
 many among the gentile proselytes refused to believe that a celestial spirit an undivided portion of the first essence had been personally united with a mass of impure and contaminated flesh and in their zeal for the divinity they piously abjured the humanity of christ
 he first appeared on the banks of the jordan in the form of perfect manhood but it was a form only and not a substance a human figure created by the hand of omnipotence to imitate the faculties and actions of a man and to impose a perpetual illusion on the senses of his friends and enemies
 a foetus that could increase from an invisible point to its full maturity a child that could attain the stature of perfect manhood without deriving any nourishment from the ordinary sources might continue to exist without repairing a daily waste by a daily supply of external matter
 in their eyes jesus of nazareth was a mere mortal the legitimate son of joseph and mary but he was the best and wisest of the human race selected as the worthy instrument to restore upon earth the worship of the true and supreme deity
 when the messiah was delivered into the hands of the jews the christ an immortal and impassible being forsook his earthly tabernacle flew back to the pleroma or world of spirits and left the solitary jesus to suffer to complain and to expire
 but the justice and generosity of such a desertion are strongly questionable and the fate of an innocent martyr at first impelled and at length abandoned by his divine companion might provoke the pity and indignation of the profane
 their murmurs were variously silenced by the sectaries who espoused and modified the double system of cerinthus
 the worthy friend of athanasius the worthy antagonist of julian he bravely wrestled with the arians and polytheists and though he affected the rigor of geometrical demonstration his commentaries revealed the literal and allegorical sense of the scriptures
 yet as the profound doctor had been terrified at his own rashness apollinaris was heard to mutter some faint accents of excuse and explanation
 he acquiesced in the old distinction of the greek philosophers between the rational and sensitive soul of man that he might reserve the logos for intellectual functions and employ the subordinate human principle in the meaner actions of animal life
 but instead of a temporary and occasional alliance they established and we still embrace the substantial indissoluble and everlasting union of a perfect god with a perfect man of the second person of the trinity with a reasonable soul and human flesh
 under the tuition of the abbot serapion he applied himself to ecclesiastical studies with such indefatigable ardor that in the course of one sleepless night he has perused the four gospels the catholic epistles and the epistle to the romans
 ardent in the prosecution of heresy cyril auspiciously opened his reign by oppressing the novatians the most innocent and harmless of the sectaries
 without any legal sentence without any royal mandate the patriarch at the dawn of day led a seditious multitude to the attack of the synagogues
 such crimes would have deserved the animadversion of the magistrate but in this promiscuous outrage the innocent were confounded with the guilty and alexandria was impoverished by the loss of a wealthy and industrious colony
 the zeal of cyril exposed him to the penalties of the julian law but in a feeble government and a superstitious age he was secure of impunity and even of praise
 orestes complained but his just complaints were too quickly forgotten by the ministers of theodosius and too deeply remembered by a priest who affected to pardon and continued to hate the praefect of egypt
 a rumor was spread among the christians that the daughter of theon was the only obstacle to the reconciliation of the praefect and the archbishop and that obstacle was speedily removed
 which oppressed the metropolitans of europe and asia invaded the provinces of antioch and alexandria and measured their diocese by the limits of the empire
 exterminate with me the heretics and with you i will exterminate the persians
 at these blasphemous sounds the pillars of the sanctuary were shaken
 but the vatican received with open arms the messengers of egypt
 the vanity of celestine was flattered by the appeal and the partial version of a monk decided the faith of the pope who with his latin clergy was ignorant of the language the arts and the theology of the greeks
 nestorius who depended on the near approach of his eastern friends persisted like his predecessor chrysostom to disclaim the jurisdiction and to disobey the summons of his enemies they hastened his trial and his accuser presided in the seat of judgment
 sixty eight bishops twenty two of metropolitan rank defended his cause by a modest and temperate protest they were excluded from the councils of their brethren
 by the vigilance of memnon the churches were shut against them and a strong garrison was thrown into the cathedral
 during a busy period of three months the emperor tried every method except the most effectual means of indifference and contempt to reconcile this theological quarrel
 return to your provinces and may your private virtues repair the mischief and scandal of your meeting
 the feeble son of arcadius was alternately swayed by his wife and sister by the eunuchs and women of the palace superstition and avarice were their ruling passions and the orthodox chiefs were assiduous in their endeavors to alarm the former and to gratify the latter
 but in this awful moment of the danger of the church their vow was superseded by a more sublime and indispensable duty
 at the same time every avenue of the throne was assaulted with gold
 the past he regretted he was discontented with the present and the future he had reason to dread the oriental bishops successively disengaged their cause from his unpopular name and each day decreased the number of the schismatics who revered nestorius as the confessor of the faith
 a wandering tribe of the blemmyes or nubians invaded his solitary prison in their retreat they dismissed a crowd of useless captives but no sooner had nestorius reached the banks of the nile than he would gladly have escaped from a roman and orthodox city to the milder servitude of the savages
 minnie's flat as the one floor resident apartments were then being called was in a part of west van buren street inhabited by families of labourers and clerks men who had come and were still coming with the rush of population pouring in at the rate of fifty thousand a year
 to carrie the sound of the little bells upon the horse cars as they tinkled in and out of hearing was as pleasing as it was novel
 to him the presence or absence of his wife's sister was a matter of indifference
 he was of a clean saving disposition and had already paid a number of monthly instalments on two lots far out on the west side
 his ambition was some day to build a house on them
 she had some slight gift of observation and that sense so rich in every woman intuition
 the walls of the rooms were discordantly papered
 the floors were covered with matting and the hall laid with a thin rag carpet
 then she walked and sang to it until hanson disturbed in his reading came and took it
 one could see that he was very much wrapped up in his offspring
 now now he said walking there there and there was a certain swedish accent noticeable in his voice
 he seemed to be thinking of something else
 minnie began to explain but her husband took this part of the conversation to himself
 you could get home easy too it isn't very far
 she asked minnie for ink and paper which were upon the mantel in the dining room and when the latter had gone to bed at ten got out drouet's card and wrote him
 she wanted to make some reference to their relations upon the train but was too timid
 anything was good enough so long as it paid say five dollars a week to begin with
 a shop girl was the destiny prefigured for the newcomer
 it was under such auspicious circumstances that she started out this morning to look for work
 narrow board walks extended out passing here a house and there a store at far intervals eventually ending on the open prairie
 it gave an imposing appearance to most of the wholesale houses whose offices were upon the ground floor and in plain view of the street
 these vast buildings what were they
 he was in a fevered state of mind owing to the blight his wife's action threatened to cast upon his entire future
 he would have to pay her the money which she would now regularly demand or there would be trouble it did not matter what he did
 he also thought of his managerial position
 how would the papers talk about it
 many little wrinkles gathered between his eyes as he contemplated this and his brow moistened
 he could arrange that satisfactorily for carrie would be glad to wait if necessary
 he would see how things turned out to morrow and then he would talk to her they were going to meet as usual
 for some reason he felt as if something might come that way and was relieved when all the envelopes had been scanned and nothing suspicious noticed
 while the danger had not lessened it had not as yet materialised and with him no news was good news
 so little did he consider drouet that it never once occurred to him to worry about his finding out
 he grew restless as he ruminated and then decided that perhaps it was nothing
 she had not been able to get away this morning
 he would get one to day it would probably be on his desk when he got back he would look for it at once
 after a time he gave up waiting and drearily headed for the madison car
 he went in and examined his letters but there was nothing from carrie
 fortunately there was nothing from his wife either
 at one thirty he went to rector's for lunch and when he returned a messenger was waiting for him
 his first impulse was to write but four words in reply go to the devil
 but he compromised by telling the boy that there would be no reply
 then he sat down in his chair and gazed without seeing contemplating the result of his work
 what would she do about that the confounded wretch
 later however his old discretion asserted itself
 something had to be done a climax was near and she would not sit idle
 he knew her well enough to know that when she had decided upon a plan she would follow it up
 he arose from his chair and went and looked out into the street
 the long drizzle had begun pedestrians had turned up collars and trousers at the bottom
 he put on his hat and looked around for his umbrella
 he would have some arrangement of this thing
 he began to wish that he had compromised in some way or other that he had sent the money perhaps he could do it up here
 he would go in and see anyhow he would have no row
 by the time he reached his own street he was keenly alive to the difficulties of his situation and wished over and over that some solution would offer itself that he could see his way out
 then he rang the bell no answer
 he rang again this time harder still no answer
 he could hardly realise how it had all come about
 no letter had come no word of any kind and yet here it was late in the evening and she had agreed to meet him that morning
 he saw that in the excitement of recent events he had not formulated a plan upon that score
 he was getting some vague comfort out of a good cigar but it was no panacea for the ill which affected him
 it was with great opposition after two or three hours of the most urgent mental affirmation and denial that at last he got an envelope placed in it the requested amount and slowly sealed it up
 then he called harry the boy of all work around the place
 any answer i guess not
 the boy hastened away and the manager fell to his musings
 he was beaten for to night and he might just as well make the best of it
 she would take the envelope and know that she had triumphed
 if he only had that letter back he wouldn't send it
 for relief he arose and joined in conversation with a few friends who were drinking
 all the time his thoughts would run out to his home and see the scene being therein enacted
 in about an hour and three quarters the boy returned
 he fancied as he sat at his desk that nothing would be done for a week or two meanwhile he would have time to think
 how about that now his pain at her failure to meet or write him rapidly increased as he devoted himself to this subject
 he decided to write her care of the west side post office and ask for an explanation as well as to have her meet him
 three o'clock came four five six and no letter
 the helpless manager paced the floor and grimly endured the gloom of defeat
 he saw a busy saturday ushered out the sabbath in and nothing done
 all day the bar being closed he brooded alone shut out from home from the excitement of his resort from carrie and without the ability to alter his condition one iota
 it was the worst sunday he had spent in his life
 it seemed as if his family troubles were just beginning
 he was quite certain now that she knew he was married and was angered at his perfidy
 he had loved her earnestly enough but now that the possibility of losing her stared him in the face she seemed much more attractive
 he would go to her and tell her all his family complications
 he would explain to her just where he stood and how much he needed her
 he did manage to bring himself into the mood to go out to carrie but when he got in ogden place he thought he saw a man watching him and went away
 he did not go within a block of the house
 he troubled over many little details and talked perfunctorily to everybody
 he stayed at his desk long after all others had gone and only quitted it when the night watchman on his round pulled at the front door to see if it was safely locked
 on wednesday he received another polite note from mc gregor james and hay it read
 very truly yours et cetera compromise
 so here it was spread out clear before him and now he knew what to expect
 if he didn't go and see them they would sue him promptly
 preface to second edition
 this is a mistake though a perfectly natural one
 on my return i purposely avoided looking into it until i had sent back my last revises to the printer
 then i had much pleasure in reading it but was indeed surprised at the many little points of similarity between the two books in spite of their entire independence to one another
 i regret that reviewers have in some cases been inclined to treat the chapters on machines as an attempt to reduce mister darwin's theory to an absurdity
 i am surprised however that the book at which such an example of the specious misuse of analogy would seem most naturally levelled should have occurred to no reviewer neither shall i mention the name of the book here though i should fancy that the hint given will suffice
 but this had an effect of which i have little reason to complain for i was allowed almost to call them life long self deceivers to their faces and they said it was quite true but that it did not matter
 i must not conclude without expressing my most sincere thanks to my critics and to the public for the leniency and consideration with which they have treated my adventures
 i also wrote about this time the substance of what ultimately became the musical banks and the trial of a man for being in a consumption
 i see from my second preface that i took the book to messrs chapman and hall may first eighteen seventy one and on their rejection of it under the advice of one who has attained the highest rank among living writers i let it sleep till i took it to mister trubner early in eighteen seventy two
 i attribute its unlooked for success mainly to two early favourable reviews the first in the pall mall gazette of april twelfth and the second in the spectator of april twentieth
 there was also another cause
 the first edition of erewhon sold in about three weeks i had not taken moulds and as the demand was strong it was set up again immediately
 i made a few further very trifling alterations before moulds were taken but since the summer of eighteen seventy two as new editions were from time to time wanted they have been printed from stereos then made
 i am still fairly well satisfied with those parts of erewhon that were repeatedly rewritten but from those that had only a single writing i would gladly cut out some forty or fifty pages if i could
 this however may not be for the copyright will probably expire in a little over twelve years
 if the reader will excuse me i will say nothing of my antecedents nor of the circumstances which led me to leave my native country the narrative would be tedious to him and painful to myself
 it will be seen that i did not succeed in my design and that however much i may have met with that was new and strange i have been unable to reap any pecuniary advantage
 no one who is himself honest will doubt my being so
 i reached my destination in one of the last months of eighteen sixty eight but i dare not mention the season lest the reader should gather in which hemisphere i was
 sheep and cattle were introduced and bred with extreme rapidity men took up their fifty thousand or one hundred thousand acres of country going inland one behind the other till in a few years there was not an acre between the sea and the front ranges which was not taken up and stations either for sheep or cattle were spotted about at intervals of some twenty or thirty miles over the whole country
 i was delighted with the country and the manner of life
 i was to see the sheep not necessarily close at hand nor to get them in a single mob but to see enough of them here and there to feel easy that nothing had gone wrong this was no difficult matter for there were not above eight hundred of them and being all breeding ewes they were pretty quiet
 there were a good many sheep which i knew as two or three black ewes and a black lamb or two and several others which had some distinguishing mark whereby i could tell them
 it is surprising how soon the eye becomes accustomed to missing twenty sheep out of two or three hundred
 it was a monotonous life but it was very healthy and one does not much mind anything when one is well
 the country was the grandest that can be imagined
 so lonely and so solemn with the sad grey clouds above and no sound save a lost lamb bleating upon the mountain side as though its little heart were breaking
 each must cry louder and wander farther yet may luck be with them both that they may find their own at nightfall
 i had no money but if i could only find workable country i might stock it with borrowed capital and consider myself a made man
 there was no one in the whole world who had the smallest idea save those who were themselves on the other side of it if indeed there was any one at all could i hope to cross it
 i would try the nearer range and see how far i could go
 shortly after passing one of these chapels we came suddenly upon a village which started up out of the mist and i was alarmed lest i should be made an object of curiosity or dislike
 my guides however were well known and the natural politeness of the people prevented them from putting me to any inconvenience but they could not help eyeing me nor i them
 the streets were narrow and unpaved but very fairly clean
 the vine grew outside many of the houses and there were some with sign boards on which was painted a bottle and a glass that made me feel much at home
 each feature was finished eyelids eyelashes and ears being almost invariably perfect
 their expression was divine and as they glanced at me timidly but with parted lips in great bewilderment i forgot all thoughts of their conversion in feelings that were far more earthly
 even in middle age they were still comely and the old grey haired women at their cottage doors had a dignity not to say majesty of their own
 the men were as handsome as the women beautiful
 i have always delighted in and reverenced beauty but i felt simply abashed in the presence of such a splendid type a compound of all that is best in egyptian greek and italian
 the children were infinite in number and exceedingly merry i need hardly say that they came in for their full share of the prevailing beauty
 i expressed by signs my admiration and pleasure to my guides and they were greatly pleased
 the country was highly cultivated every ledge being planted with chestnuts walnuts and apple trees from which the apples were now gathering
 i saw a few sheep with rounded noses and enormous tails
 in about four hours of walking from the time we started and after passing two or three more villages we came upon a considerable town and my guides made many attempts to make me understand something but i gathered no inkling of their meaning except that i need be under no apprehension of danger
 suffice it that i found myself taken before the chief magistrate and by his orders was placed in an apartment with two other people who were the first i had seen looking anything but well and handsome
 in fact one of them was plainly very much out of health and coughed violently from time to time in spite of manifest efforts to suppress it
 the other looked pale and ill but he was marvellously self contained and it was impossible to say what was the matter with him
 they felt my pulse they looked at my tongue they listened at my chest they felt all my muscles and at the end of each operation they looked at the chief and nodded and said something in a tone quite pleasant as though i were all right
 but by and by they came to my watch which i had hidden away in the inmost pocket that i had and had forgotten when they began their search
 again there was a very old carriage whose wheels in spite of rust and decay i could see had been designed originally for iron rails
 we passed many cases and at last came to one in which there were several clocks and two or three old watches
 the design was different but the thing was clearly the same
 this had some effect in calming him
 he began presently to relent and spoke to me in a kinder manner
 i imagine there were several kinds of old fashioned christmases but it could hardly be worse than a chop in my chambers or horror of horrors at the club or my cousin lucy's notion of what she calls the festive season
 festive yes
 the reply was written in a sprawling feminine hand it was a little vague
 it appeared that the terms would be five guineas but there was no mention of the length of time which that fee would cover
 the whole thing was a trifle odd
 there was nothing said about the sort of accommodation which would be provided nothing about the kind of establishment which was maintained or the table which was kept
 now it is a remarkable thing that i have always had an extraordinary predilection for the name madge i do not know why
 i have never known a madge and yet from my boyhood upward i have desired to meet one
 under such circumstances she was hardly likely to be lively herself but her name was madge and it was the accident of her christian name which decided me to go
 i had no illusions
 i did not expect a princely entertainment
 all night it had been blowing and raining
 i felt quite lively myself as i mingled with the christmas crowd looking for things which might not turn out to be absolutely preposterous
 i even bought something for madge i mean missus wilson
 it was a horrible journey
 he was impervious to reason
 it is some satisfaction for me to be able to reflect that i made it warm for the officials however cold i might have been myself
 when at last i reached crofton my journey's end it turned out that the station staff consisted of a half witted individual who was stationmaster porter and clerk combined and a hulking lad who did whatever else there was to do
 no one had come to meet me the village was about half a mile and hangar dene the house for which my steps were bent about four miles by the road how far it was across ploughed fields my informant did not mention
 there was a trap at the boy and blunderbuss but that required fetching
 when the trap did appear it looked to me uncommonly like an open spring cart
 in it i was deposited with my luggage
 i did not know what he meant
 i did not ask i was beyond it
 i was chilled to the bone wet tired hungry
 i had long been wishing that an old fashioned christmas had been completely extinct before i had thought of adventuring in quest of one
 here we be that might be so
 there be the door in front of you you go up three steps if you can find em
 there's a knocker if none of em haven't twisted it off
 there appeared to be no knocker though whether it had been twisted off was more than i could say
 no answer though i allowed a more than decent interval
 better ring again suggested the driver hard
 maybe they're up to some of their games and wants rousing
 the bell reverberated through what seemed like an empty house
 presently feet were heard advancing along the passage several pairs it seemed and a light gleamed through the window over the door
 a voice inquired who's there
 the information was greeted with what sounded uncommonly like a chorus of laughter
 there was a rush of retreating feet an expostulating voice then darkness again and silence
 who lives here are the people mad
 i tolled the bell again
 after a vast amount of unfastening the door was opened and on the threshold there stood a girl with a lighted candle in her hand
 i'm mister christopher from london
 we've lost the key of the cellar and there's nothing out except water and i don't think you'd care for that
 her father is a most remarkable person to say the least
 but it is quite plain to me that all the arrangements for my wedding are going to be made by the snellings
 i do not know when it is going to be but it will be either next week or the week after certainly at the earliest possible moment and i shouldn't be at all surprised to learn that all mary ann's things had been already bought and perhaps some of them marked
 it is most delightful
 it might just as well be some one else's wedding so unimportant is the part which i am set to play in it
 for instance look at their behaviour in the matter of the ring
 the accident in question occurred upon the sunday evening
 the girl is fretting but you don't seem to notice it
 i gasped positively gasped
 that's it on your account
 from a cousin of ours who's in that line
 i never saw people like the snellings for possessing relatives in all sorts of lines
 i was persuaded that somebody besides that cousin got a profit out of mary ann's engagement ring but i handed over the amount
 it is from her action in that matter that my suspicion springs
 there she owns a cottage or it may be a pigstye for all i know
 when she heard of my engagement with mary ann she wrote and suggested that we should spend our honeymoon in her cottage or pigstye and that i should pay her rent for it
 there were no signs of faltering about her flow of language
 i found that as a woman of business she was beyond all my expectations
 it turned out that she had a little money of her own about a hundred and thirty pounds a year
 and of course i had my expectations and she had hers
 it was plain that together we should manage most comfortably delightfully in fact
 i shall make papa give me five hundred pounds at least
 a bird in the hand is worth two in a bush' and it will be something to have by us
 i know what mamma can afford to give and i will see she gives it
 and i will see that there is no shirking about the boys or about the girls either
 i have drawn up a list of all the people who ought to give us a present and i shall tell them what they ought to give it won't be my fault if i don't get it
 of course there are some people with whom you can't be perfectly plain but i shall be as plain as i can there's a way and a manner of doing that kind of thing
 hers has been prodigious
 she has a knack of getting people to do what she wishes and to give her what she wants which is a little short of miraculous
 i notice that they are generally persons who have already tendered their offerings
 the fact of having given mary ann a wedding present seems to fill them with a feeling of rancorous acidity which to me is inexplicable
 such is the selfishness of human nature
 but why on that account they should pity me i altogether fail to understand
 we have all been giving mary ann presents and i suppose you mister whiting have been giving her something too
 that was what missus macpherson said to me only the other day
 and what inquired missus macpherson has mary ann given you her love
 someone sniggered
 i cannot pretend to explain why except on the supposition that romance is dead at least in that circle of society in which the snellings move
 as it is unless i am mistaken some of the rending will be on our side and they know it
 p s the cards are out for the wedding
 we are going for our honeymoon to italy and the south of france
 a second cousin of mary ann's is in the cook's tours line
 he has given us free passes all the way to the end of our journey and all the way back again and coupons for free board and lodging at the hotel it's a wedding present
 besides which we can always sell the coupons and railway passes which we don't use
 one who writes of such an era labours under a troublesome disadvantage
 in the present case that disadvantage is doubled for while the sins of the church however heinous were still such as admit of being expressed in words the sins of the heathen world against which she fought were utterly indescribable and the christian apologist is thus compelled for the sake of decency to state the church's case far more weakly than the facts deserve
 not be it ever remembered that the slightest suspicion of immorality attaches either to the heroine of this book or to the leading philosophers of her school for several centuries
 that divine word who is the light who lighteth every man which cometh into the world had awakened in the heart of mankind a moral craving never before felt in any strength except by a few isolated philosophers or prophets
 the very emperors had arrayed themselves on her side
 julian's last attempt to restore paganism by imperial influence had only proved that the old faith had lost all hold upon the hearts of the masses at his death the great tide wave of new opinion rolled on unchecked and the rulers of earth were fain to swim with the stream to accept in words at least the church's laws as theirs to acknowledge a king of kings to whom even they owed homage and obedience and to call their own slaves their poorer brethren and often too their spiritual superiors
 but if the emperors had become christian the empire had not
 but the health of a church depends not merely on the creed which it professes not even on the wisdom and holiness of a few great ecclesiastics but on the faith and virtue of its individual members
 the mens sana must have a corpus sanum to inhabit
 and the new blood at the era of this story was at hand
 tribe after tribe was crowding down to the alps and trampling upon each other on the frontiers of the empire
 the huns singly their inferiors pressed them from behind with the irresistible weight of numbers italy with her rich cities and fertile lowlands beckoned them on to plunder as auxiliaries they had learned their own strength and roman weakness a casus belli was soon found
 how iniquitous was the conduct of the sons of theodosius in refusing the usual bounty by which the goths were bribed not to attack the empire the whole pent up deluge burst over the plains of italy and the western empire became from that day forth a dying idiot while the new invaders divided europe among themselves
 the countless treasures which five centuries of rapine had accumulated round the capitol had become the prey of men clothed in sheepskins and horse hide and the sister of an emperor had found her beauty virtue and pride of race worthily matched by those of the hard handed northern hero who led her away from italy as his captive and his bride to found new kingdoms in south france and spain and to drive the newly arrived vandals across the straits of gibraltar into the then blooming coast land of northern africa
 that extraordinary reform in morals which according to salvian and his contemporaries the vandal conquerors worked in north africa availed them nothing they lost more than they gave
 climate bad example and the luxury of power degraded them in one century into a race of helpless and debauched slave holders doomed to utter extermination before the semi gothic armies of belisarius and with them vanished the last chance that the gothic races would exercise on the eastern world the same stern yet wholesome discipline under which the western had been restored to life
 to synesius's most charming letters as well as to those of isidore the good abbot of pelusium i beg leave to refer those readers who wish for further information about the private life of the fifth century
 i cannot hope that these pages will be altogether free from anachronisms and errors
 the place seemed fragrant with all the riches of greek thought and song since the days when ptolemy philadelphus walked there with euclid and theocritus callimachus and lycophron
 the room had neither carpet nor fireplace and the only movables in it were a sofa bed a table and an arm chair all of such delicate and graceful forms as may be seen on ancient vases of a far earlier period than that whereof we write
 but most probably had any of us entered that room that morning we should not have been able to spare a look either for the furniture or the general effect or the museum gardens or the sparkling mediterranean beyond but we should have agreed that the room was quite rich enough for human eyes for the sake of one treasure which it possessed and beside which nothing was worth a moment's glance
 she has lifted her eyes off her manuscript she is looking out with kindling countenance over the gardens of the museum her ripe curling greek lips such as we never see now even among her own wives and sisters open
 if they have ceased to guide nations they have not ceased to speak to their own elect
 if they have cast off the vulgar herd they have not cast off hypatia
 to be welcomed into the celestial ranks of the heroic to rise to the immortal gods to the ineffable powers onward upward ever through ages and through eternities till i find my home at last and vanish in the glory of the nameless and the absolute one
 i to believe against the authority of porphyry himself too in evil eyes and magic
 what do i care for food
 how can he whose sphere lies above the stars stoop every moment to earth
 ay she answered half bitterly and would that we could live without food and imitate perfectly the immortal gods
 there is fruit with lentils and rice waiting for you in the next room and bread unless you despise it too much
 strange that men should be content to grovel and be men when they might rise to the rank of gods
 not that such a creature as that disturbs me no created thing i hope can move my equanimity but if i could stoop to hate i should hate her hate her
 and her voice took a tone which made it somewhat uncertain whether in spite of all the lofty impassibility which she felt bound to possess she did not hate pelagia with a most human and mundane hatred
 his excellency madam the prefect
 and why should that disturb me let him enter
 master and man dismounted from their beasts and as soon as they had settled themselves at the foot of the trees sancho who had had a good noontide meal that day let himself without more ado pass the gates of sleep
 but don quixote whom his thoughts far more than hunger kept awake could not close an eye and roamed in fancy to and fro through all sorts of places
 at one moment it seemed to him that he was in the cave of montesinos and saw dulcinea transformed into a country wench skipping and mounting upon her she ass again that the words of the sage merlin were sounding in his ears setting forth the conditions to be observed and the exertions to be made for the disenchantment of dulcinea
 who is touching me and untrussing me
 dulcinea is perishing thou art living on regardless i am dying of hope deferred therefore untruss thyself with a good will for mine it is here in this retired spot to give thee at least two thousand lashes
 seeing this sancho got up and grappling with his master he gripped him with all his might in his arms giving him a trip with the heel stretched him on the ground on his back and pressing his right knee on his chest held his hands in his own so that he could neither move nor breathe
 how now traitor exclaimed don quixote
 dost thou revolt against thy master and natural lord
 dost thou rise against him who gives thee his bread
 don quixote gave his promise and swore by the life of his thoughts not to touch so much as a hair of his garments and to leave him entirely free and to his own discretion to whip himself whenever he pleased
 sancho rose and removed some distance from the spot but as he was about to place himself leaning against another tree he felt something touch his head and putting up his hands encountered somebody's two feet with shoes and stockings on them
 he trembled with fear and made for another tree where the very same thing happened to him and he fell a shouting calling upon don quixote to come and protect him
 don quixote did so and asked him what had happened to him and what he was afraid of
 sancho replied that all the trees were full of men's feet and legs
 don quixote was on foot with his horse unbridled and his lance leaning against a tree and in short completely defenceless he thought it best therefore to fold his arms and bow his head and reserve himself for a more favourable occasion and opportunity
 he was mounted upon a powerful horse and had on a coat of mail with four of the pistols they call petronels in that country at his waist
 he saw that his squires for so they call those who follow that trade were about to rifle sancho panza but he ordered them to desist and was at once obeyed so the girdle escaped
 he saw me he paid court to me i listened to him and unknown to my father i loved him for there is no woman however secluded she may live or close she may be kept who will not have opportunities and to spare for following her headlong impulses
 in a word he pledged himself to be mine and i promised to be his without carrying matters any further
 give me my horse and arms and wait for me here i will go in quest of this knight and dead or alive i will make him keep his word plighted to so great beauty
 nobody need have any doubt about that said sancho for my master has a very happy knack of matchmaking it's not many days since he forced another man to marry who in the same way backed out of his promise to another maiden and if it had not been for his persecutors the enchanters changing the man's proper shape into a lacquey's the said maiden would not be one this minute
 they made haste to overtake them which as the party moved slowly they were able to do with ease
 the wounded gentleman opened his all but closed eyes and recognising claudia said i see clearly fair and mistaken lady that it is thou that hast slain me a punishment not merited or deserved by my feelings towards thee for never did i mean to nor could i wrong thee in thought or deed
 on perceiving this claudia when she had convinced herself that her beloved husband was no more rent the air with her sighs and made the heavens ring with her lamentations she tore her hair and scattered it to the winds she beat her face with her hands and showed all the signs of grief and sorrow that could be conceived to come from an afflicted heart
 cruel reckless woman she cried how easily wert thou moved to carry out a thought so wicked
 o husband whose unhappy fate in being mine hath borne thee from the marriage bed to the grave
 the servants wept claudia swooned away again and again and the whole place seemed a field of sorrow and an abode of misfortune
 claudia told him she meant to go to a monastery of which an aunt of hers was abbess where she intended to pass her life with a better and everlasting spouse
 claudia would not on any account allow him to accompany her and thanking him for his offers as well as she could took leave of him in tears
 sancho said they had but that three kerchiefs that were worth three cities were missing
 what are you talking about man
 said one of the bystanders i have got them and they are not worth three reals
 at this instant one or two of those squires who were posted as sentinels on the roads to watch who came along them and report what passed to their chief came up and said senor there is a great troop of people not far off coming along the road to barcelona
 what led me into it was a certain thirst for vengeance which is strong enough to disturb the quietest hearts
 and if you have any desire to shorten the journey and put yourself easily in the way of salvation come with me and i will show you how to become a knight errant a calling wherein so many hardships and mishaps are encountered that if they be taken as penances they will lodge you in heaven in a trice
 and now the squires despatched to make the prize came up bringing with them two gentlemen on horseback two pilgrims on foot and a coach full of women with some six servants on foot and on horseback in attendance on them and a couple of muleteers whom the gentlemen had with them
 the captains showed plainly the concern they felt the regent's lady was downcast and the pilgrims did not at all enjoy seeing their property confiscated
 the regent's lady ordered one of her servants to give the eighty crowns that had been assessed as her share at once for the captains had already paid down their sixty
 one of the squires observed in his mixture of gascon and catalan this captain of ours would make a better friar than highwayman if he wants to be so generous another time let it be with his own property and not ours
 they were all taken aback and not one of them dared to utter a word such deference did they pay him
 every elevation of the type man has hitherto been the work of an aristocratic society and so it will always be a society believing in a long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human beings and requiring slavery in some form or other
 the distinctions of moral values have either originated in a ruling caste pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruled or among the ruled class the slaves and dependents of all sorts
 we truthful ones the nobility in ancient greece called themselves
 it is obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first applied to men and were only derivatively and at a later period applied to actions it is a gross mistake therefore when historians of morals start with questions like why have sympathetic actions been praised
 he honours whatever he recognizes in himself such morality equals self glorification
 probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of man will find expression perhaps a condemnation of man together with his situation
 here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good and evil power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil a certain dreadfulness subtlety and strength which do not admit of being despised
 according to slave morality therefore the evil man arouses fear according to master morality it is precisely the good man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it while the bad man is regarded as the despicable being
 everywhere that slave morality gains the ascendancy language shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words good and stupid
 or he will even say for many reasons i can delight in the good opinion of others perhaps because i love and honour them and rejoice in all their joys perhaps also because their good opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion perhaps because the good opinion of others even in cases where i do not share it is useful to me or gives promise of usefulness all this however is not vanity
 in fact conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social order and its cause the blending of the blood of masters and slaves the originally noble and rare impulse of the masters to assign a value to themselves and to think well of themselves will now be more and more encouraged and extended but it has at all times an older ampler and more radically ingrained propensity opposed to it and in the phenomenon of vanity this older propensity overmasters the younger
 the most varied experience teaches it what are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact that it still exists in spite of all gods and men and has hitherto been victorious these qualities it calls virtues and these virtues alone it develops to maturity
 variations whether they be deviations into the higher finer and rarer or deteriorations and monstrosities appear suddenly on the scene in the greatest exuberance and splendour the individual dares to be individual and detach himself
 at this turning point of history there manifest themselves side by side and often mixed and entangled together a magnificent manifold virgin forest like up growth and up striving a kind of tropical tempo in the rivalry of growth and an extraordinary decay and self destruction owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly exploding egoisms which strive with one another for sun and light and can no longer assign any limit restraint or forbearance for themselves by means of the hitherto existing morality
 nothing but new whys nothing but new hows no common formulas any longer misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other decay deterioration and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled the genius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopias of good and bad a portentous simultaneousness of spring and autumn full of new charms and mysteries peculiar to the fresh still inexhausted still unwearied corruption
 danger is again present the mother of morality great danger this time shifted into the individual into the neighbour and friend into the street into their own child into their own heart into all the most personal and secret recesses of their desires and volitions
 what will the moral philosophers who appear at this time have to preach
 this is the problem of race
 in our very democratic or rather very plebeian age education and culture must be essentially the art of deceiving deceiving with regard to origin with regard to the inherited plebeianism in body and soul
 the noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without question and also without consciousness of harshness constraint or arbitrariness therein but rather as something that may have its basis in the primary law of things if he sought a designation for it he would say it is justice itself
 on this account the people of one nation understand one another better than those belonging to different nations even when they use the same language or rather when people have lived long together under similar conditions of climate soil danger requirement toil there originates therefrom an entity that understands itself namely a nation
 the greater the danger the greater is the need of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary not to misunderstand one another in danger that is what cannot at all be dispensed with in intercourse
 also in all loves and friendships one has the experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery has been made that in using the same words one of the two parties has feelings thoughts intuitions wishes or fears different from those of the other
 whichever groups of sensations within a soul awaken most readily begin to speak and give the word of command these decide as to the general order of rank of its values and determine ultimately its list of desirable things
 a man's estimates of value betray something of the structure of his soul and wherein it sees its conditions of life its intrinsic needs
 profound suffering makes noble it separates one of the most refined forms of disguise is epicurism along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste which takes suffering lightly and puts itself on the defensive against all that is sorrowful and profound
 the highest instinct for purity places him who is affected with it in the most extraordinary and dangerous isolation as a saint for it is just holiness the highest spiritualization of the instinct in question
 occasionally too the waking call comes too late the chance which gives permission to take action when their best youth and strength for action have been used up in sitting still and how many a one just as he sprang up has found with horror that his limbs are benumbed and his spirits are now too heavy
 and whoever thou art what is it that now pleases thee
 only name it whatever i have i offer thee
 but you misunderstand him when you complain about it
 there must be a sort of repugnance in me to believe anything definite about myself is there perhaps some enigma therein
 probably but fortunately nothing for my own teeth perhaps it betrays the species to which i belong but not to myself as is sufficiently agreeable to me but what has happened to you
 i do not know he said hesitatingly perhaps the harpies have flown over my table
 to suffocate with his memories to him who has the desires of a lofty and dainty soul and only seldom finds his table laid and his food prepared the danger will always be great nowadays however it is extraordinarily so
 and to choose for company that roguish and cheerful vice politeness
 shiloh
 this was the first big battle in which our regiment had ever been engaged
 i do not pretend to tell of what command distinguished itself of heroes of blood and wounds of shrieks and groans of brilliant charges of cannon captured et cetera
 about daylight on sunday morning chalmers brigade relieved gladden's
 as gladden rode by us a courier rode up and told him something
 on sunday morning a clear beautiful and still day the order was given for the whole army to advance and to attack immediately
 we were supporting an alabama brigade
 that's right my brave first tennessee give em hail columbia
 the fact was kept from the troops
 we had to pass over the ground where troops had been fighting all day
 i had heard and read of battlefields seen pictures of battlefields of horses and men of cannon and wagons all jumbled together while the ground was strewn with dead and dying and wounded but i must confess that i never realized the pomp and circumstance of the thing called glorious war until i saw this
 i had been feeling mean all the morning as if i had stolen a sheep but when the order to charge was given i got happy
 officers could not curb the men to keep in line
 on monday the tide was reversed
 but as i said before reader a private soldier is but an automaton and knows nothing of what is going on among the generals and i am only giving the chronicles of little things and events that came under my own observation as i saw them then and remember them now
 should you desire to find out more about the battle i refer you to history
 about the time he pulled trigger a stray ball from some direction struck him in the side and he fell off dead and his horse becoming frightened galloped off dragging him through the confederate lines
 on monday morning i too captured me a mule
 he was wise in his own conceit
 i frequently thought it would be pleasant to split the difference with that mule and i would gladly have done so if i could have gotten one half of his no
 mule did not desire to cross while i was trying to persuade him with a big stick a rock in his ear and a twister on his nose
 so he got a large two inch rope tied one end around the mule's neck and the other to the caisson and ordered the driver to whip up
 the rope however was stronger than the mule's no and he was finally prevailed upon by the strength of the rope to cross the creek
 on my taking the rope off he shook himself and seemed to say you think that you are mighty smart folks but you are a leetle too smart
 we remained several months but soon we were on the tramp again
 the federal army was concentrating at nashville there was no rest for the weary
 our army stopped at murfreesboro
 from time to time different regiments were sent forward to do picket duty
 the yankee picket lines were not a half mile off
 i am a videt you know the responsibility resting on me
 says he i would not trust a secesh on his word oath or bond march i say
 i soon found out that he had caught sight of the relief on the road and was afraid to shoot i quickly made up my mind
 my gun was at my feet and one step would get it
 i made a quick glance over my shoulder and grabbed at my gun
 he divined my motive and fired the ball missed its aim
 i think we must have killed a good many in the old field because we were firing all the time at the solid line as they advanced upon us
 we kept falling back and firing all day and were relieved by another regiment about dark we rejoined our regiment
 line of battle was formed on the north bank of stone's river on the yankee side
 bad generalship i thought it was christmas
 the private could but he was no general you see
 the yankees marched over the hill out of sight
 we were ordered forward to the attack
 we were right upon the yankee line on the wilkerson turnpike
 we were not twenty yards off from the yankees and they were pouring the hot shot and shells right into our ranks and every man was yelling at the top of his voice cease firing you are firing on your own men cease firing you are firing on your own men
 oakley color bearer of the fourth tennessee regiment ran right up in the midst of the yankee line with his colors begging his men to follow
 the leaden hail storm swept them off the field they fell back and re formed
 we were at that time at least a hundred yards in advance of the brigade cheatham all the time calling upon the men to come on
 i saw and felt that he was not fighting for glory but that he was fighting for his country because he loved that country and he was willing to give his life for his country and the success of our cause
 i thought it had been torn from my shoulder
 as i went back to the field hospital i overtook another man walking along
 i looked at it pretty close and i said great god
 he was walking along when all at once he dropped down and died without a struggle or a groan
 but i could not bear the thought of wearing dead men's shoes
 he was stone dead but i dropped that foot quick
 before we arrived at the house we saw a body of yankees approaching and as we started to run back they fired upon us
 our pickets had run in and reported a night attack
 advance into tennessee
 yank says what you doing johnny
 we passed around atlanta crossed the chattahoochee and traveled back over the same route on which we had made the arduous campaign under joe johnston
 outside of these occasional reminders we could see no evidence of the desolation of the track of an invading army
 we saw the united states flag flying from the ramparts and thought that yank would probably be asleep or catching lice or maybe engaged in a game of seven up
 he walked up and says hello boys what is it boss
 a yankee always says nager
 they persuaded eloquently
 a man in the well
 the voice appeared to be overhead
 right before me i saw the long dry grass all bending toward a common center and i knew that it was an old well and that my comrade had fallen in it
 but how to get him out was the unsolved problem
 the poor fellow stayed in that well all night
 we looked all around and thought that the coast was clear
 i don't think his gun was loaded though because we did not hear the ball whistle
 we walked over this floating bridge and soon found ourselves on the tennessee side of tennessee river
 we had beef for supper that night
 how every pulse did beat and leap and how every heart did throb with emotions of joy which seemed nearly akin to heaven when we received the glad intelligence of our onward march toward the land of promise and of our loved ones
 we were inured to privations and hardships had been upon every march in every battle in every skirmish in every advance in every retreat in every victory in every defeat
 he wanted to go by home and tell his wife and children good bye and to get his clothes it was no go
 you see jim knowed the law
 those old soldiers had long long ago forgotten about that old law of the long gone past but jim had treasured it up in his memory lo these many years and he thought it would serve him now as it had no doubt frequently done in the past
 the third day it was reported that the yankees had taken position on the murfreesboro pike
 a regiment was sent to the attack it was jim's regiment
 he hadn't seen anything to shoot at but he blazed away he loaded and fired the second time when they were ordered to retreat
