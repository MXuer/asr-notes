 uhhuh
 uh do we know if there will be a lot of people coming across the hall in terms of security stuff if we can i mean my idea is to put the photocopier and the fax in the hall
 um
 okay
 um
 okay
 okay
 um
 um yeah
 yeah
 yeah and that's it
 um
 uhhuh
 um
 yeah
 um yeah
 uhhuh okay  
 rooms yeah and do we need a room like a reading room or yeah
 um
 okay
 yeah
 um yeah
 um
 the first split we can do is between administration and reasearch uh i mean it's completely different work so we can deal with administration and decide something for administration and then
 for the other
 yeah but at least deal with that particular situation and then see with the other because i was thinking uh gisella is quite i mean gile- gisella's work is quite noisy because it's secretary so yeah lot of phone call and stuff like that so yeah so you won't share an office with gisella unless you are fifty per cent and not the fifty per cent gisella is working which is another condition
 yeah um
 so i don't know maybe we can decide that gisella is having one of the one person room
 um
 yeah
 yeah but at least the thing we know that gisella is going to be alone
 or with equipment but
 humanly alone yeah  
 yeah
 yeah
 and then i think the main discussion we should have is
 um if we want to make group of among the same project or among the same title
 or yeah or yeah couple of professor and assistant or
 that's more a conceptual question   than a practical question  
 yeah
 yeah
 um
 yeah um
 um yeah
 yeah yeah but we will have this reading room which can be
 um
 yeah for a real meeting
 um
 yeah
 um
 no
 yeah
 um yeah
 um yeah the other thing we should take into account is if you receive student or not because
 marianne and i interact a lot with student and we have reception hours and stuff like that so it means   you get time where a lot of people come along and talk and so it's maybe
 yeah so maybe it's not really nice to have to share an office with somebody like us   having a lot of social life and  
 yeah
 um
 yeah
 um
 yeah i don't know
 yeah um um
 yeah
 yeah  
 um
 yeah but that's something we can't reasonably assume like that and make plans with that because
 yeah
 um
 yeah
 uhhuh
 i don't know
 yeah
 one point i can say by experience it's really hard to share an office with three people because it makes much more noise that only being two in an office
 plus the computers so
 yeah   so we might be it might be a good idea to first exclude one of the three person room   to be the reading room and not to be necessary
 a room with three people a working room
 oh yeah um oh yeah
 okay
 yeah
 yeah yeah
 so the other solution is to say okay we use a three person room but only with two person each time and leave a spare space for or
 but avoiding
 having three person fulltime in a same room could be a good idea i think
 yeah
 um
 so for the reading room we will have a two person room
 okay
 yeah
 which one
 with the mountain
 yeah it's
 big black stripe is the windows not the thin one between the big   but what about the d- the other one which has only one windows but in the courtyard it maybe more quiet
 we have electricity so
 i hope
 no it's a question i mean it it's quite noisy outside with the streets and
 yeah we are on the sixth floor
 yeah and stop reading
 so it's a relaxing room
   yeah yeah no okay
 yeah yeah
 um yeah yeah
 um so what about one of the room in the corner so you have three windows it's even better
 but you have less wall to put shelves and stuff like that
 if you intend the reading room being more a library or
 um
 yeah
 um
 yeah um
 yeah
 kind of yeah small library
 no no no no no no sure but yeah
 um
 so are we all agree about these two person rooms
 which one   corner or not corner
 the middle one okay
 yeah um
 okay
 uhhuh
 so we can exclude this one to make an office
 or maybe write on the board i don't know
 so we have the map and
  
   it's alright
 three yeah
 yeah yeah um
 so
 okay
 is that a mountain okay
 and that an old town
 yeah should we decide also the administration stuff and
 so we exclude the n- the thing we are quite sure and then we discuss the
 that's really noisy to be in the same office with the administration
 yeah that just imply you expect people to come when gisella is not working and that's not really fair if you
 so we can put gisella in the two people room
 which is near the mailbox
 no
  
 i don't know
 i- it's just the question you always have the phone ringing even if the af- even when she's not working
 yeah
 yeah but that's that's a good point from nikos to say that she needs to be n- near the mail box and the printer and
 and the photocopier and stuff like that
 yeah exc- except the door is not really
 convenient
 no but i think if if the main um how can i put that the um
 if the main reason to put to to choose gisella's place is the proximity of the mailbox it should be a two pe- people room and not a three people room
 otherwise we have a one people room and
 yeah
 yeah no but it's it's also it's also the place of the photocopier
  
 yeah
 because if we put the photocopier near the mail box and it seems to be the only place where there is room for that
 yeah
 yeah oh no
 yeah no it's too
 and it's too big and
 yeah okay
 and then we can for the moment put gisella in this corner room if you agree i don't know
 yeah
 but this option of putting gisella near the photocopier  
 i mean she is not sharing an office i mean sh- we put some   trainee   in gisella's office because there is a spare room and that's quite imp- yeah that's quite uh i mean that's quite important to keep a spare room in gisella's office if we need more staff but
 i wouldn't work in gisella's office
  
 yeah yeah
 um yeah
 for example and there is no room in the cupboards for any people except gisella because she got lots of paper archives and files and stuff like that so it's really she needs
 space
 um yeah
 hmm
 yeah
 are you sure it's southwest i don't know if thi- if this map is a
 okay the map is north oriented okay no
 okay   i don't know
 anyways yeah but
 okay you know because with mountain mountains and old town it's not no sorry until but
 okay
 no because sunrise and sunshine is quite uh sunshine sunrise and sunset is quite also a good um
 something to take into account  
   uh northeast
 sunrise
 it's east yeah east no east
 we we have sun in the morning only
 so it does mean that the three piece room which is in the opposite of the northeast is the most sunny one
 let's say that
 it's it's the one you have of now you both
 more or less
 you get the sunset then no and it's really warm and
 do you uh by the way is it a six floor building or is there more
 okay so it's warm
 um okay
 um
 so how many   rooms
 and uh how many place do we have
 yeah plus one spare place but really the last place to be used
 yeah
 okay
 we got two three four six nine
 fourteen places
 for fourteen people
 yeah
 t- okay
 bless you
  
 so
 can we group people by their name   i to marianne so it's going to be mariannes' office
 yeah that's going that can be that's boring but that can be a good idea but do do we can we do that because there is no we can't because no we can't there is two
 and two three person room
 yeah so
 um yeah yeah
 yeah
 i think we clear the things a little bit up too s- yeah
 yeah
 yeah yeah
 okay
 so let's have a break save your file
 you have x  p 
 that's nice
 okay so as you guys know f- issco is too small well the building is too small for our group so we're moving to a new building uh it's going to be the building across the street and we're actually moving in three weeks but the problem is that the administration wants to know who is going to be in what office in the new building and where we're g- we're going to put things like the printer the fax machine all the big equipment and the catch is that they have the final approval of where we put people and equipment and they want to know where we're going to do all this by november second
 so that means basically next tuesday and since we don't really have any other time we have to make these decisions today what we're getting is nine rooms for a maximum of eighteen people which is okay because there's only fifteen of us and all the rooms have windows luckily so there's no fights about who gets a window and who doesn't um there's two views either of the old town or the mountains and the rooms have various sizes there's two three people rooms five two person rooms which are on the corners of the building so you actually get windows on two walls and two one person rooms
 that's pretty much what the building looks like um and then you have the number of people per room the courtyard because we're on the sixth floor you can't actually go out to it but it just means that the windows look out onto open space um you can see the bathrooms the elevators are sort of further down the hall the purple bar at the bottom sort of on the right is the mailboxes all of the windows open you can get out onto the terrace just like we can in our normal building and the equipment that we have to put somewhere are like i said the photocopier which is really big the fax machine which is not so big and the printer which is relatively big
 each office has a white board a bulletin board and a coat rack no cupboards like we have in the current offices and each person gets their own chair their own corner desk so like the n- the ones that we have now um a small filing cabinet with three drawers and by small i mean they're about that tall and one sort of hanging shelf so we don't get the bookcases like we have now but just one shelf that's attached to the wall
 and the people that we have to place uh you can see the list there along with their position and the project that they work on and i guess the question the first question is   how we want to organize people whether we want to do it   by rank or by project or
 i don't know put all the p  h  d  students together all the professors together that sort of thing so the idea is that we come up with a plan there's another group who's going to be working on the same plan later this week and then andre and i have to do presentations for the university administrators on the second so we have to come up with a plan possibly if we have time a presentation a quick presentation with arguments for why we think our plan works best okay
 so   anyone have any ideas or
 i guess
 yeah um i think it's the security is sort of the same as it is in the current building so as long as the things are physically attached to the wall so they can't be removed then it should be okay to leave them in the hall
 it's just a question of whether you are printing sensitive documents or n- whatever
 um well we get one sort of networked printer and then i think some of us have personal printers   i think susan has a personal printer gisella has one maybe
 i can't remember who else yeah but noone else gets their own printer in terms of equipment it's sort of the same thing as we have now
 um
 so what i'd propose is that we sort of discuss various concepts without getting into specifics and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back later in the day with sort of more specific proposals as to exactly where to put people
 does that work oh and on the map the little half circular well quater circles are doors   which i'm assuming you've figured out but just in case and there's just the one room that actually has two doors going into it the the three person room on the right yeah
 yes yeah a lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room
 so we should leave a space for that and we can because like i said maximum eighteen people in those rooms and there is only fifteen of us and i don't know if you've noticed but two of us are only here half the time so martin and david um are half the time at the e  p  f  l  and half the time in geneva so
   sort of keep that in mind i guess when
 you are doing the actual planning
 yeah
 uhhuh yeah
 but gisella's really the only administrator yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 and she's always moving around
 no
 yeah
 which i don't know if we can assume that there isn't going to be any overlap between them
 yeah either that or   maybe put her in a two person room with the equipment or
 like with the the photocopier or maybe not the photocopier but the printer
 yeah yeah
 and not with a hundred percent staff yeah a staff worker
 yeah i mean the rooms aren't tiny if you look at the this
 yeah yeah that makes sense to put the fax in there
 uh
 so
 yeah
 yeah
 well the third option is just completely mix everyone up which some people say is better sort of for a group environment so that you are not stuck only with the people who are working on your project right so if you share an office with someone who's on a completely different project you find out about that project but you also sort of interact with other people on a more regular basis
 yeah
 i think it's not a question of reserving it because there's other rooms at the university that you can reserve for a meeting but if it's empty then sure you can use it for a meeting there's nothing wrong with that but i think if someone's already reading in there it's not fair to go and kick them out just because you want to have a meeting because
 but if you're having a short meeting you don't really
 make an appointment for it you just kind of go to someone's office and go down for a coffee or whatever
 because there's still the cafeterias that you can use for informal
 yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah and the other marianne too so there's three of you
 well but then you either share offices with each other which doesn't really solve the problem because chances are you are not going to have office hours at the exact same time
 so you're still   going to have
 like unless you get individual offices i don't know if there's an easy way to find a solution for that
 because even if each of you share with a professor then it's the same thing for the professor
 but it is something to keep in mind
 unless you end up sharing an office with someone where your schedules completely don't overlap and then you can schedule office hours when the other person isn't there some people come in around eleven and some people come in around eight
 no
 no but you sort of see people's patterns i mean
 even if it's not always like that i mean if it's like that you know eighty per cent of the time then
 but you're right we can't make assumptions too much
 i think
 well it's up to us how we do it i can see benefits of both
 but
 yeah plus the computers
   and we all know what it's like to have five computers in your office  
 yeah that's a good point because if we take the three person room out as a reading room
 then everyone has an office right because it's maximum eighteen
 so take away three spaces and you're down to your fifteen and you're right if we do have a stagieur whoever who comes in then we have nowhere well we can put them in the reading room but that kind of defeats the purpose
 uhhuh
 yeah
 yeah
 or again find people who don't work the same hours
 it doesn't completely solve the problem but
 yeah i think so
 a one person'll be too small anyways
 the one on the bottom
 yeah
 two well which w- there's three two person rooms
 that has two windows
 which is fine and still a big room
 yeah so i should have explained that  
 yeah but then you get don't get a lot of light
 for reading
   really  
 that's
 i don't know i like the idea of looking out over
 lots of space
 well i mean that that's the whole point right it's just somewhere to get out of your office and go and do something else for a while whether you're reading or just kind of staring off into space
  
 yeah we could do that
 yeah
 we have some shelves like cabinet type shelves for the reading room but it's not really intended to be a library i mean we have
 an i  t  library um but
 the other idea is to take because right now we all have bookshelves so one idea might be to take sort of the books that aren't frequently used by people put them all into that room so it becomes sort of
 a mini library but not like a library system library just go and borrow your collegues' books
 i think the middle one
 yeah it's also sort of m- central to the layout so everyone sort of has more or less the same distance to
 it's not that it makes that much of a difference but
 why not
 uh
 yeah
 actually what i can do is
 yeah um actually that's a good idea j- just put it up
 yeah
  
 so
 this really isn't to scale but oh well
 um
 that's really not to scale   um so we've got an office there
 and there's
 two and one
 is that all
 okay so this is
 that and this becomes the reading room right
 yes  
 sure
 yeah
 okay
  
 but if gisella works fifty percent and they work fifty percent
 that's true
 yeah
 but
 just
 does gisella have her own printer
 well if you put her in in this room here it's relatively close
 true
 yeah
 i don't know how much the proximity to the mailbox matters because usually when she's here and she picks up the mail she actually brings it to your office it's more the i  t  administration that uses our mailboxes
 that's true
 yeah
 yeah unless you put it into an office which is just an- annoying i think because even if you put it into gisella's office it's going to be
 yeah
 so
 um
 at the beginning we said that we were going to give her one of the one person rooms
 okay
 yeah  
 well she's go ahead
 stagieurs in there
 and they are not really in a position to complain  
 yeah
 i think it's just a question of work conditions like if you are a stagieur and you co- only coming in for two months then you can put up with it but if you're there you know for the full year
 uhhuh
 yeah
 yeah in there if they need to go
 yeah
 yeah
 south- well southwest if that's north
 southwest for us no tha- well i'm assuming that's what you meant right that
 but that's southeast anyways
  
 this office right that's
 no i i'm very bad at orienting where's north in geneva i always get it wrong but i just assumed nikos was talking about the orientation here
 oh that's true
 so wait we face the old town we face the old town now and we are facing
 northeast
 okay so
 this is northeast
 yeah
 uhhuh
 this one
 it's the oven
 yeah we're the top floor
 yeah
 it the building design is pretty much the same as the one we have now we're just getting more space this way because we couldn't move in the other building because it was occupied by the other departments
 actually why don't i change it on here as well
 so that's gisella
 plus fax
 and then this is the reading room
 oops
 um
 so that leaves us with what six eight   fourteen places which is
 for f- yeah no for fourteen because gisella's already got a room
   excuse me   okay um
 so i'm going to take gisella off of
 that list as well i'll put her in gray i guess
  
 that's boring  
 can we
 no
 we have we have one extra one person office and
 two three person offices yeah plus we have the two people who aren't there now
 that we have to put somewhere
 we can keep some of the people together that are together now but
 not everyone definitely
 well why don't we take a break and go off and think about it
 and then once we have more concrete ideas we can come back and finish it because if we just sit here and discuss it's going to take a long time and we're going to start arguing and get cranky and
 alright so
 yeah
 yep
 uhhuh   okay
 uhhuh
 alright
 we can put it uhhuh
 um
 okay
 okay sure yeah  
 that's a good idea
 ad- administrator
 yeah that would be
 maybe convenient
 with someone
 yeah and with someone who is who is fifty pro- percent
 yeah okay uhhuh
 typing machine  
 yes yeah
 or uh yeah professor assistent or uh
 or uh yeah
 yeah
 yeah that's true
 um um
 but still i find it's quite easy if you are with people who work in the same project in the same room because you have the meetings or people come and ask you discuss things maybe i don't know if it's uh
 for other people who is not working on the same project yeah that's true that's that's true yeah
 you can u- uhhuh
 meeting about the project
 uhhuh
 yeah hmm
     people coming and going
 yeah we don't
 yep yeah
 um
 yeah it certainly is
 plus the com- uhhuh
 yeah but if there are people coming in i mean we have these people working for uh two months who comes in the summertime or something i th- think we should reserve a little bit space for them too so uh
 it's quite big
 um
 for soemthing yeah um
 yeah that's yeah certainly is
 maybe that would be good
  
  
 on the sixth floor i don't know
   yeah if you are if you are reading
  
 do so- yeah
 why not yeah
 a library down- downstairs um
 in the middle yeah
 oh it's g- good enough
  
 and uh gisella
 we thought a one person room
 person room
  
 or f-
 yes yes she does
 and the place where we all pass kind of
 it should be some central place
 yeah that's a good idea
 i- it yeah so for example now if uh we reserve
 yeah yeah but we can uh reserve so if you reserve a two people room we can put uh trainees
 further on if they are in the same room
 in the corner
 south
 southeast yeah that's southeast
  
  
 north
  
 when do we have sun
   but s-
  
 well there is a quite a lot of sun
 y- yes and no it's yeah it's really warm that's
 yeah yeah that's true
 okay uhhuh
 okay good p- so
 and next
 so we have reserved now two two person rooms
 uhhuh
 for fifteen people
 yeah yeah yeah
  
   marianne marianne   yeah why not
   yeah that would be fun
 that's boring  
 no we don't
 okay
  
  
  
 so we only get one printer for fifteen people
 the three person room
 um
 yeah i w- i would suggest that too yeah
 okay so th- that's a one person room but we don't know how how big they are or it's hard to tell i mean gisella has this funny uh typing uh thing yeah
 computer fax
 so probably sh- she should get the fax right
 okay uh will it be dedicated for reading and for studying or can we have meetings there can reserve it for meetings
  
   well the the problem is if you have to go across the building and it adds some overhead every time you want to have some short meeting and discuss some issues   or maybe we shouldn't call it reading room but  
 so people would like to see uh the office organized by uh by by rank like professors and students and
  
 yeah that's a good idea yeah
 yeah everybody agrees on that yep
 how about how about this room
 yeah at the bottom in the middle with a view to the mountains yeah it has three windows so i think it's uh two
 o- one two
 the the middle one
 two
 oh the big oh   ah okay  
  
  
 me too
 yeah and you can look outside of the window if you have a sh- quick meeting there you know quick meetings always get longer
   i don't know
  
 i was thinking of maybe we should assign gisella into this three person office
 because w- we will probably place the printer next to the mailboxes then we could have gisella and the two fifty per cent people sharing the three
 person room
 well th-
 they're fifty per cent yeah
  
 well i mean it
 w-   yeah we could
 we could i mean i don't know how noisy she is   it's uh  
  
  
 convenient for her yeah
 okay it's fine with me
 yeah it's it's not the m-
 yeah yeah
 y-
 okay we should write this down do we agree that the that the photocopier and the networked printer goes next to the mailboxes
 yeah what with
 i mean she is sharing an office right now and i   has anybody heard of any complaints that she's too loud or
  
 okay
 yeah that's true
 she needs spaces okay
 okay so gisella at this southwest office
 yeah yeah that that one yeah
 oh right yeah that's southeast yeah it's
 yeah this office yeah
 uh yeah i was just talking about uh here on the map
  
 the three people room or
  
 you get lots of sun during summer yes
 plus spare yeah
   we got
 for fourteen people
 yeah
 so we are good
  
   alphabetically
 is is any- is there anybody who's not happy with the current situation so we could try to just keep the same arrangement just on the new building
  
 okay
 so let's start then top to bottom maggie
 susan
 so how long is
 i don't think they are concrete proposals
 no
 yeah this makes sense
 yeah it's up to them i guess uh
 up to us well i mean they they can switch later they can switch later
 pirette next
 who
 so   i don't know we spent quite some time at the last meeting and t- to decide this and now we are just
 of course but everybody had the documents before so you could have studied them so i don't think it's a good idea yeah m-  
 w- i i i don't mind going into this office
 no
  
 oh why not
 yeah
 no
  
 maybe we can put pierrette and her t- two two p  h  d  students into one room
 um yeah mayb- maybe the other one would be more convenient if we are all working on the same project so we are close by
 um
 agnes
  
 yeah
 why
 okay w- w- why don't we move maria to this to where to the office i'm supposed to be and i can go with nancy
 if you think that
 but is this about windows or is it about it it it must be functional if you and martin work on the same project then
 yeah we can each other yeah  
 i agree but the setup is pretty good now so bruno is not on and he's sharing um office uh i'm not sharing somebody with i work on the same project
 uh um yeah
  
 martin and you yeah
 yeah what is it now  
 bu- s- somebody has to be
 well will there be wireless in the building i mean if there are reception hours so somebody could move to the reading room and have people
 well isn't this the case doesn't everybody has one no
  
 um
 no hmm i have no problem with that
 um
 yeah who does anyway
 so maybe you and bruno should take this office
 yeah that's a good idea
 and it's not very healthy either yeah  
 um
 suggestion if possible we could move me and yalina to the office where andrei and nancy are now
 no i i just it's just more convenient if i'm closer with my
 the partners of my project
  
 she's the heart of the
 it's not kitchen  
  
  
 well it's it's ideal for nancy she is just very close to the lifts
 excellent yeah
 so when exactly are we supposed to move
 three weeks so they've set up everything wiring uh internet or what's the sta- the status right now
 s-
 well there are lots of walls we can put posters on
 yeah we don't want to micro manage things yeah
 can you mail a copy of that to everybody
 not really
 yeah
 yeah yeah
 suzanne for example
 uhhuh
 so what do you think for uh
 susan and maggie for example the
 the rooms for one person
 naturally
 yeah to  
  
   i would say not together in a three it's quite a lo- yeah yeah
 some
 just yeah
 yeah it's quite dark
 yeah it would be nicer
  
   finally you think
 yeah i agree it's uh
  
 you you said that there is electricity  
 in the
 well let's uh how we can uh fill the three person rooms
 uh how we ge- who we going to put in the three person rooms i mean we have now a two three person rooms left and um
 yeah yeah um we do um
  
  
 so where were we uh pierrette uh andrei nancy
 yeah why not
 all two mariannes or
 and you too okay   so we need a  
   yeah i'd like to have a view to the mountains but well  
 yeah
 well that's that will do but uh
 yeah well f-   yeah it's uh yeah old town is as well as well yeah that's alright   yeah yeah and that's good because there are pirette marianne and nikos they are on the other side of the corridor so it's yeah
 who is left um   who
 and
 yalina ya- yalina would be good and actually she is working for the same project as well
 with beautiful laughter  
 and anyway martin is just a fifty per cent
 okay
 that's all
  
 how i- how it looks like
 yeah you can
   ah
 yeah uh that was my question
 yeah i mean   with whom you'd you'd to with whom you'd like to work in the same office i mean is it important to have someone uh from the same project or um
 yeah we can skive but you're going to disturb all the people
 we're going to disturb all the people by skiving all the time
  
 yeah that's for sure
 with
 yeah i yeah i don't know you were saying that uh maria and nancy doesn't fit   together in the same
 so what you say if you change the office uh i don't know and you work with nancy or uh
 what do you yeah i don't know
 for example
 yeah
 sounds okay
 what do you say
 sorry
 no what's bothering you
 i thi-   i think  
   and now you are you are changing your mind all the time
 yeah but if you work with the people like pirette and marianne uh
 well at um
  
 uh well  
 pirette is having quite a
 unadvantaged situation because there are marianne and bruno who are having uh reception hours so it's going to be a qui- yeah so it's quite a
 traffic there i would say
  
 no
   so well of course if they put uh
  
 the aim having a room room for reading or
 yeah
 people  
   well you can   you als-   already speak quite well finnish so we might get along yeah   yes i will  
 it's easy for them to
 find the people
 it only goes on yalina
 yeah we have to from the other side of the
 but well
 yeah the people having students  
 yeah if we change the
 three people
 pirette marianne david david
   with here and uh
 yeah   we got it  
 w- with the mount- ah my mountains yes i got the mountains
   and bathrooms are nearby yeah
  
  
 fifty per cent yeah
 yeah looks good
 yeah i think too i'm quite happy with it
  
 yeah
 yeah but it's quite logical to have the for the professors one person rooms   i think
 for the yeah
 we can skive as you said  
 yeah
 person rooms uhhuh
 and the projects they're they are quite well grouped actually now
 and well gisella she is kind of
 in the middle
 yeah   department
 in the reading room that would be good
   oh it's not ah it's  
 yeah good coffee
 yeah   quite strong strong good coffee
  
 uh yeah  
 yeah
 if you late uh you work late yeah and you drink uh coffee yeah
 is there actually a smoking uh area somewhere
 not for me but
 but we okay we have the terrace still on the sixth floor or uh how how no not at all they have to go down yeah
 yeah yeah
 and susan maggie as well
 yeah i think it's okay let's see what the the other ones say
 three weeks
 okay
 my boxes ah   yeah
 that might be a good idea
 well mai- mailing lists
 of course you can mail em- yeah if you have something
 ah okay yeah a posters okay that's kind of thing yeah yes
 or in front of the reading room or
 yeah
 um
 no more special
   wishes
 yeah you know
 no it's kind of we should maybe find a method to do   stuff like i don't know choose one parameter
 the first parameter to choose people to choose where to put people like i don't know maybe permanent staff and non permanent staff we know that professor will stay for a long time we uh we don't know for the other
 so
 maybe that could be the first parameter to take into account not just to have this dis-
 yeah and have this discussion every two years
 because it's
 you know
 make sense for everyone so we can choose where to put uh i would say the the the three first one of the list yeah yeah yeah and yeah
 um and maybe the two other senior andrei and nancy
 and then yeah
 um
 yeah that could be an idea
 yeah um
 yeah
  
 can switch
 yeah
 which is
 so we need to put pirette andrei and nancy do we want to the the question is now is do we want to put the three together or the three completely separate
   with
 other people
 yeah yeah
 some some yeah but few less than pierrette
 so we have a
 um
 yeah
 um i just realized something   the two people room in the middle which has only one windows
  
 it's going to be pretty hard to put two people inside that room
 yeah
 yeah except we yeah and near the photocopier
 yeah
 and what about the reading room
 yeah but you   i mean   uh i think everybody is supposed to spend more time in their office than in the reading room so we might think that it's better to have a more comfortable office than a more comfortable reading room i don't know it change the plan of the morning i'm sorry but i just realized that stupid architect put only one windows
 who built this building do we know that  
 i don't know what do you think
 yeah
 yeah i know but in the last meeting nobody just
 took attention at this one windows problem and i think it is one problem
 yeah you too i can i can say the thing to you i'm sorry  
 the two people that's really welcoming and warming
 yeah
 what what what say it again
 no no but the main problem we have the same number of place and the same number of people now yeah and uh i just noticed that we have this two people room
 with only one windows yeah you don't mind to have okay so nikos and you have to find yeah you have to find somebody agree to come with you and it's not a question of you it's a question of windows  
 who would you put with you let's put a fifty per cent so
 from the david yeah do you know david you will learn to know him  
 so david and nikos it's done
 and with um pirette uh
 andrei and nancy
 how many p  h  d  student does she have
 and me
   yes i'm doing a p  h  d    yes officially     um
 so and can you put the the map again so we s- see what happen
 um
 that's that might be a good idea to put pirette with two p  h  d  student whoever they are
 which one
 okay
 so pirette and
 the two mariannes
 okay so wha- put me with marianne and pirette it's alright
 and we put marianne in front if she want to be
 no on the room on the opposite oh no that's the old town view
 pick a room   is that alright is the old town view beautiful enough
 um yeah okay so marianne and who do you want to work with
   nancy martin pirette no pirette is done
 andrei yalina maria and agnes okay okay so put   yalina with um
 yeah
 okay
 and we have uh
 now
 do you think it's a good idea to put martin and andrei together since they are working on the same project
 yeah and we might put martin and andrei and someone else in the three person room since the fifty per cent it's a good
 okay
   maria and nancy
 that's really strange
  
 so what do we think about that  
 uhhuh um yeah
 i think this project thing is not good thing
 this project splitting i mean
 splitting by project
 yeah no but if you if if you split by project you put me in one person room  
 that's hard
 could you say that again
 okay
 okay
 so you just
 you just move him or
 the two groups you just
 yeah
 no
 except coffee time and that's important project too but uh gossiping and stuff like that yes um
 yeah
 and it's quite funny to to to hear   other
 activities around you and not always the same stuff
   especially when it's activity that you don't understand or   yeah
 yeah
 no that's quite nice
 oh yeah
 yeah yeah okay why not
  
 i'm not totally convinced
 i'm not convinced about this i don't know
 yeah first of all no from the beginning i said the three person room it's quite i mean it's a disadvantage
 and um
 to change a little bit this disadvantage we put somebody fifty per cent in
 three person room so we could do the same in the three person rooms but there is still this problem yeah
 yeah
 yeah it's here for working not not us but exactly
 and you so there is no view  
 and pirette as well we uh all have uh reception hours
 yeah
 yeah
 you can move with your desktop yeah
 no
 yeah
 yeah okay
 yeah
   okay can we say that david uh is yeah instead of
 okay but okay no because i was thinking of we can um
 having these two office which are near to the lift
 keep this office for reception people
   if i can con-   we are pirette the two marianne and i are receivi- and maggie and susan are receiving a lot of student so we  
 with the finnish for example if you want me
 yeah so that's ki- yeah yeah okay lopeta
 yeah yeah uh that's nice to have a corner a student i mean a student area
 you know what i mean yeah to find us and it's also quite noisy when you have this kind of
 parade of student before the exams so if you work with me and you have this
 agree with that
 so and the photocopier is still
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 no but it's too far from
 yeah
 okay
 yeah
 that's quite good and then yeah
 so we have a three windows' room   with view everywhere aha
 yeah
   we close the door
 yeah and
 i think that's quite nice
  
 and then and put david
 in a two person office and why
 no no the reason to put pirette and marianne marianne and i together is because of the noise we make by receiving students
 and then the reason to put david in this office it's because yeah it's fifty per cent in a three
 um
 place office
 um
 that sounds nice no
 and i think we do have the best office uh it's a kind of dictatorship decision but we are here to make a decision so
 and agnes you're going to sell this to the administrator
 yeah so
 the argument of student yeah you can also s- oh yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 is
 yeah
 yeah but we all work on different projects so we can't
 what is the little square d- you put oh a printer and the photocopier okay
 that's quite fine
 student reception
 you
 okay
 no yeah that's fine
 so the arguments are uh student reception
 in one corner
 yeah
 the fifty per cent
 staff
 in the three
 person room
 yeah yeah
 and um the two um and the two professor is one single
 yeah
 centered
 and since you nee- you will meet the administrator can we ask for a coffee machine somewhere   yeah or in that hall i mean the sixth floor there is no coffee machine on the sixth floor
 no no um a vending machine
 yeah but try
 wi- with good coffee italian one please
 yeah
 and herb tea
 for the afternoon
 h- herb tea
 for the afternoon yeah because with strong coffee i don't t- sleep
 yeah
 yeah yeah um
 and do we know if there will be air conditioning
 no no no there is no terrace on that building
 so no we're not going to change the plan only for the smokers
 exactly as well
 i think it's fine
 okay is everyone happy with that
 um
 wow
 that's very professional yeah
 hmm
  
 uh can
 can we think of putting a white board somewhere in the hall for general information
 yeah
 yeah but i mean you have a nice poster of the next conference you don't put it you know a a big board with
 along one of the wall yeah
 yeah
 um yeah
 ooh
 i think it's everybody's responsibility to find
 if they prefer to be in front of back to window or whatever i mean if we start doing that not happy
 we are all adults so i think we can all speak and
 uh okay
 i hope yeah
 okay
  
   okay
 okay so now that we've all had a bit of time to think about it um does anyone have any concrete proposals or do we want to just
 go through people and start placing them and kind of discuss as we go along
 nope
 okay
 yeah
 yeah that's true
 yeah give them like the most comfortable offices and
 yeah
 because a professor but he's only here half time so it's sort of a different situation
 and he's a professor at but not in geneva he just does research in geneva
 yeah
 okay so let's
 go through that first um
 yeah and for susan probably yeah because i think she prefers to have her own office
 um okay any preferences to which one
 okay i put susan here for now
 and then maggie in the other one
 no it's up to us   they're not here so
 um okay
 and then
 yep
 um
 well pierrette has students and andrei and don't well does andrei s- he teaches but okay
 yeah
 because also if we're going to put people together by projects then there's no sense to put them together because they all work on different projects
 right
 um
 yeah
 because they'll fight for the window
 what about moving gisella in there
 if she's in there half the time she can have her desk near the window and okay she's not near the mailbox but
 but it maybe more sort of practical in terms of working environments for people
 but again one of the reasons for putting the reading room where it is is so that you have
   you think  
  
 yeah
 i don't know  
 or what if you put
 what if we put the two people that are fifty per cent in that room yeah
 but they are only here fifty per cent
 so everyone has to go somewhere
 and you also have one three person room with two windows
 nikos volunteers
  
 who you're taking with you
  
 okay well   okay so let's put david in there yeah
 you'll meet him   okay
 so i'm just going to
 make a list on here of who we have
 keep talking
 with pierrette
 okay so david nikos gisella maggie and susan are done
 okay
 yeah
 okay should we be nice and give them three windows
 okay
   that won't get confusing  
 where here
 oh here
 would have to be here or the other three person room
 pick a room  
 well she's not that far if she's like like in this one here
 okay so you want this one
  
 um
 okay
 yalina
 yeah that could work
 in room yeah
 yeah
 okay
 um
 i guess i can go in there because martin and i wor- are working on the sort of the same thing
 and that leaves
 and nancy
 yeah that's a weird combination  
 no it's not that it's just you've almost got like a project split
 except that you don't because
 nancy and maggie and i work on premindia parmenidy-   parmenidies and then andrei martin maria and i also work on
 and sort of susan although the susan and maggie thing we can't really change
 no
 but then we should split the little party up
   all on your own
 hmm
 see i would put it the other way i would put the room with martin in it in the two window room because he's fifty per cent so then at least
 the other two people get
 put martin in the three person room with   two windows
 since he's fifty per cent
 either way well i don't know for splitting up
 people or
 well i'm trying to optimize
 i don't think it's necessarily so important to be in the same office with someone
 if you're working on the same project
   because you're too lazy to get up and walk next door  
 i don't know like right now i share an office with bruno we don't work on any projects together
 yeah of course but i mean   that's fine like i don't need to be in the same office with someone who works on or
 someone who works on parmenidies
 it's not like   yeah
 know anything about yeah you hear things out of context what  
 okay
 i just can't really see them sharing an office i don't know why
 or we put andrei and nancy to- nancy together because they're starting that new
 project and then put maria with
 me and martha i can see that working a bit better
 hmm
 i thought you were saying you didn't want to be in a three person room first of all  
  
 yeah and put david but then you and nikos have the window problem which is why i still think we should put gisella in that room because
 it's
 she gets the window the whatever he's there for two months it's their problem yeah   not for enjoying the view  
 so
  
 yeah but if you put
 so what if we
 switch no
 you have to have a computer with wireless
 no well most of us first of all have desktop computers   pick up your desktop and plus you can't assume that you can just use the reading room for reception hours
 right like if people are actually using it as a reading room
 yeah
 can we say we're going to move gisella here
 and then
 i think that gives us a little bit more flexibility to play with moving people around goes here
 you were the first one on the list but if you want to remove someone else
 yeah
 uhhuh so what if we put you with yeah will you have   okay so
 i'm just putting yalina in so we don't
 yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah
 uhhuh
 or do you want to go somewhere else
 here
 you just don't photocopy
 well you have the other
 lift
 the switch
 with   here
 so like that and then move you to
   that's what the plan was from the beginning
 do you get the photocopying noise now we are all going to come photocopy just to annoy you  
  
 okay
 or did was the id-
 i should start start making full sentences
 what about  
 i was thinking about moving pierrette and marianne into a two person office rather than a three person office
 but  
 with andrei and nancy for example
 no in a three person office because if they have reception
 i know i thought you were saying that
 pierrette should have a smaller office
 or be in a smaller office because of reception or something or did i just completely misunderstand
 okay
 is because he's fifty per cent okay
 okay that works
 uhhuh
  
 i'm going to try yes
 okay what arguments do i need
 well we have the the group and students here although you still have susan and maggie over here
 yeah
 so it is sort of a well no it's not a project split
 it's weird because it kind of is and kind of isn't
 because maria and martin and i work all work on the same project and then andrei and nancy work on the same project and pierrette n- yeah
 and yeah
 okay let me just write down the arguments for why um
 uhhuh
   you just want a bigger window
  
 happy
 that's noise reduction
  
 okay
 now they are yeah
 except for david but we can't do anything about that
  
 you mean like
 a little machine or a vending machine
 okay
 the little machine i think would be harder to sell but
 i will
   nespresso  
 with the good strong coffee what did you say hot tea
 oh herb tea
  
 nope nonsmoking building
 no they'll have to go down  
 and susan maggie close enough yeah
 okay
 yeah i think so
 just checking if actually have everyone but i think we do
 in was it what did i say three weeks
 as far as i know yeah as far as i know basically we pack up one day the movers come take all our stuff put into the red boxes so when you get there the next day all your stuff is already in your office
 and all the i  p 's and everything is set up they're trying
 so we'll see make sure you label your boxes properly
 um   especially the marianne's  
 yeah so they won't confuse it get confused with the other marianne's boxes
 uh we can try
 i can ask them
 but that's not really
 um where
 like along gisella's
 yeah
 okay so
 along that bottom hallway somewhere
 okay
 anything else i need to ask them
 okay
 i don't actually we may need to sort out
 that's not healthy um who
 i don't know if we need to sort out who sits where because if they're going to plug everything and set everything up
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah no no yeah
 i just can't remember whether they're actually going to set everything up for us or not but we can change it i guess
 okay
 that's it then save this
 yep
 not right now because i'm not connected to the internet
  
 but i will
 okay
 good we're done then
 um so hi everyone thanks for coming to this meeting um   well as you all know the topic of this morning's meeting is uh the fact that we're moving and we are going to get more space so that's a very good piece of news uh but we also have to find out how we use this space
 so um if you want i'll just give a brief overview of what's happening and then we can uh talk about well arranging these new uh the new office space so um in case you haven't seen the the documents uh let me just uh show you very briefly the the configuration of the the space
 so um   well there is nothing much to say well you know how many of us are are present and you know that we are um a bit tight actually in our present location uh that's why actually the university finally um allocated us this uh this part of uh the unimail building so it's at the sixth floor and it's uh sort of contiguous rooms as you you can all see from uh from here um so the the the one p  two p  three p  means the the number of persons as you can see we have several corridor um with a number of uh of uh of rooms of one person rooms two person room and and three person rooms um actually i think agnes did this nice drawing so she even put the the view so we have the old town on one side and the mountains on the other two sides uh we have some bathrooms for us uh and a courtyard which actually means a sort of uh shaft because uh the court is uh down at uh the first floor
 well it's a bit difficult to say because um in fact we have some constraints in terms of furniture uh they are here so um well your your person your your question actually is answered maybe by the third item so each person should get um well it's a sort of desk it's made of two pieces and it looks like a corner with of course a chair uh a filing cabinet that goes under the desk uh and well we can put hanging shelves over the the desks so i'm not really sure it's possible to get three um three desks in a two person office but um we could try what's what should be said here i don't know if well   you i i will maybe distribute now documents if you don't have them maybe it's easier do you need something martin um i can keep this for you uh so it's it's yeah you have a copy susan you too david i think so in fact there are more places than people so we won't be that constrained uh as you know some of us and some of you here actually martin and david are parttime so it it's for the moment quite comfortable normally we should even get an extra uh an extra place for you know temporary people coming to work on uh on projects uh yeah i uh yeah i counted so we have um fifteen pers- physical persons and about uh sixteen i think uh persons oh actually eighteen persons in the offices
 exactly it so one of the issues uh here it's probably not on the slides is that we would like to have uh unlike what had until now a lounge or reading room uh in one of the the offices so in one of the rooms
 um i think quite a lot of people e- expressed the need for that so if we could do it then i think it would be much nicer um let me also uh st- say something yep
  
 yeah i i think so
 uhhuh
 well sixteen slots for fifteen people so it's still should be feasible
 that's
 yeah i think that's quite important to manage some space maybe we can think of yeah some two or three yeah for visiting people correct
 uhhuh okay so let me finish with the the constraints which are almost done so we also need to to find the a spot for the photocopier the fax machine and the printer the fax you know is very small but um the photocopier is quite huge and the printer is uh well ab- this size um okay the offices comes with white boards not very uh very important uh the furniture that w- each each person has and uh you have a list of people
 so the thing uh you you ought to know is that we're not the only ones that w- we're thin- that that are thinking about uh for well about putting people i- in these rooms um there is another group that is also having discussions so the idea is that today we'll just try to f- start seeing the main constraints and then you have time to to go and think about it uh ask the people you know your assistants for instance and at the next meeting we'll try to to come with one solution uh the other group will also propose a solution and then there will be another negotiation so w-
 uh if i- if we don't get these um well basically they are promised to us so uh do do you think there are chances that they take from us one of the rooms or uh
 yeah i i i think it's uh uh   yeah
 yeah i- yeah that's one of the the problems i think maybe we should take this into account and maybe think of some of the bigger rooms with four people one being temporary or or parttime um okay so maybe we could try to to see now what would be the main options say the general uh well arrangement options do you think that we should put people say according to projects for instance in in the table that um that we have uh we also have the uh uh the p- the main projects on which the people are working so how yeah uhhuh
 oh actually what is fixed is the n- the number of rooms this we cannot really change i mean   at least not us it would be much more difficult to get another another room for instance but what is absolutely n- not fixed is the arrangement of the people in the rooms so basically we are all the permutations are possible at the moment
 um
 well what we are looking for is a solution that suits everyone and that makes the maximum of people happy so uh the other group is uh i don't think we have to see them as competitors but they are just trying to to find another local optimum or l- uh
 uh
 yeah yeah uh uh we yeah i i think that's yeah there is no real competition between the two but we'll just try to find at least two solutions and see how how close they are actually it's it's i think well the m- the people who who decided this thought it was the best solution to um well you know find two two kinds of opinions yeah well we could have been eight h- sitting around here and and talking but i think it's it's more difficult
 uhhuh
 well
 exactly i think so so today the goal is not to to find the solution today but to set some constraints and then go and see the people and find out if they have any preferences obviously we won't be able to accommodate all the the preferences but at least we'll find the most uh the most important ones
 p- s- i think
 uhhuh
 yeah i think so that's one of the things i think we know that they have students we don't know exactly if they prefer for instance to be alone or to well to be with their assistant or even with another person working on the project so that would have been maybe yeah another solution is to ask everyone to provide uh an arrangement but uh i think that's a bit uh a bit hard then to to work out um so since all of you have a copy of the uh well of the drawing i think for the next time m- maybe you could come with a concrete proposal with uh names on it but let us try to see today whether we prefer to organize people say by projects or just professor and assistant so what would be f- say first your preferences since let's let's start with us maybe today um what do you think about it would you prefer to be alone would you prefer to be with your assistant you who are parttime do you think you can come here on a very w- well regular schedule or is it parttime but variable during the week
 uhhuh and since you're coming on the uh halftime do you think you will be able to group your presence here say monday tuesday and wednesday morning or is it going to be m- much more random
  
 okay
 yeah i think so too um so martin you are also uh halftime and well the third person is gisella i think it's quite clear that um each person should have their own desk and yeah it's no no way we we could put two persons at the same desk
 yeah i think grouping
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 are you disturbed by the phone calls of other people okay
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
  
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 like cubicles
 uhhuh
   yeah i i i will try to find out whether we can separate i think for the moment the answer at least is no because um it's not only well making a wall but also b- um making a new door so it's quite a lot of uh of work but uh i will try to find this out for the next time um so at least for the moment as you can see there are uh i can show them here on the screen so there are these two rooms on the left that uh accommodate one person so at least some of the professors since you are four uh could could go uh well could take these uh these rooms and quite a lot of rooms with two persons uh how do you feel susan about the professor sharing the room with her assistants or the one which is the most involved in in the teaching
 hmm
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
   yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah that's um that's true um okay um maybe we could s- look a bit at the projects do you think it's a good idea to put together in the same room as much as possible people from the same project since they talk quite a lot of to each other
 uhhuh okay
 well yeah and some of the p  h  d  students will hopefully finish their p  h  d  at some point  
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 okay yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah
 yeah well actually so the lounge could serve as some kind of meeting room but there are also more formal meeting rooms available in in the building as we now know
 uhhuh
 uhhuh so i think we need a
 yeah and and i think also we need a separate discussion on the furnishing of the lounge which is a whole other topic  
 uhhuh
 um
 yeah yeah for the moment actually i think only one slot would be fully free uh that is yeah
 yeah that means one visitor at a time or one intern yeah that's uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah it's already in progress and you're you're working uh i think yeah w- okay so one of the things i have to do for the next time is fin- find out about the separations between rooms and
 yeah i think it's quite a heavy transformation of the building
 uhhuh
 uhhuh and okay i'll try to find out and the other question is can we squeeze maybe four people in the uh or at least four places in the three three p  room
 yeah hopefully visitors don't need as much say filing space or um yeah they don't have that many papers uh okay so that's uh i have to to ask so you don't really feel um very strongly attached to this uh grouping by projects idea uhhuh um
 yeah exactly
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah they they can change
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah i think that's that's going to be one of the the main things we'll have to ask is whether people have strong preferences either in staying with someone or in uh not staying um are you aware f- of any strong constraints right now  
    
 oh
 okay yeah that's true so smoking is now um no longer a constraint  
 yeah
 yeah that's the new regulation
 uh on the balcony actually yeah normally
 yeah uhhuh
  
 uhhuh
 o- on the toilets or  
 uhhuh
 yeah
 uhhuh yes martin said also for him and yeah especially for her yeah the in- she's the interface so uhhuh
 yep
 uhhuh
 yep yeah
 yeah i think yeah uhhuh i think putting gisella with the other admin of the school is not an option because we weren't offered yeah it would be nice but uh okay i'll try to find out but uh
 i th-
 yeah
 okay we'll try but all these yeah are say sort of difficult questions because they involve changing also the offices of the school and you know people just don't want to change in general um let's see maybe we can find some temporary well at least a proposal for gisella so since the one person rooms are quite well sort of um desired by a lot of people she should probably no y- yeah okay
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uh the the middle one here okay
 this one okay
 uhhuh well
 yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah yeah well
 uhhuh
 yeah
 uhhuh yeah because in this case yeah gisella could take one of the the two person rooms and the other place would be for some kind of visitor that
 i- or
 ah okay uh
 yeah or an intern uhhuh
 yeah okay   okay so this sets a bit the stage for uh for gisella then uh yeah we'll try to to find out um actually yeah maybe we should remind that quite a lot of professors at the at the school actually share their office with their assistant so b- it looks like sort of an implicit tradition maybe not to be followed  
 okay  
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah
 um okay so i think well this sets a bit uh the stage uh could we try so could you try please to uh do you want an extra uh piece of paper maybe try to well think on your own and then talk a little bit just to the people around you
 uhhuh
 yeah no the point was to try to well just talk to them to david or
 uhhuh
  
 yeah so w- w- w- will you ask people just for their place or also for the other people's place   because uhhuh
 well but that's
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah
   okay th- then okay then for the next time um try to come up either with your own preferences that's quite easy probably to state now that you know the constraints or if you can poll a little bit the people around you that would be i mean even
 well just discuss i- yeah for instance i mean no no i was thinking just ask people around you   what they think about this and i think yeah it will be nice to to come with maybe a sketch of of these if you can do slides it's even better but uh don't be that formal and uh we'll try to at least build up one coherent proposal and we'll merge it with the other one when the other one uh is available
 um oh great
 uhhuh perfect
 yeah
 and i'll try to
 fine
 what do you mean by cafeteria exactly
 what
 yeah w- we can bring your coffee in the reading room but
 so so since maybe you're a parttime here and part ti- parttime at e  p  f  l  there are at least two um coffee machines in the building one at the third floor one at the first floor and we can bring our coffee no uh automatic uh coffee machines so uh yeah but in
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah vending machines uhhuh okay   yeah maybe this is not a very bad timing could we try to meet uh next tuesday   um next tuesday maybe at t- maybe a bit later maybe at eleven o'clock
 come on try try to be nice
 gi- give me a reasonable date
 yeah for me it's a good timing
 uhhuh okay
 okay
 uhhuh
 very well so about two o'clock would that be okay after lunch it's not a very demanding meeting so um perfect um then let me close this
   and uh good luck for your arrangement games  
 uhhuh
 uh they have another group and then uh uh uh andre and agnes will discuss about it with you are the rep- representative of this group actually
  
 hmm
 yeah uh okay uh me personally i would like to to to share the other peopl- n- uh the room with assistants as when you have problems of normal life like uh the printer doesn't work uh i don't want to ask this to my supervisor so it's better to to be with a with an assistant to share the room
 uhhuh
 what uh i don't think it's a good idea to share uh t- to ha- to share the same desk   uh i still would like to have my drawers and these things
 it's
 it's funny that uh we move to another building because we run out of uh space and we will have the same problem
 ah okay
  
 but uh usually whe- when new assistants come they would like to share the room with someone that knows uh l- uh it's related with the project so he can
 um
 no okay
 uhhuh
  
  
 is it allowed to smoke inside an office if it's a one person no not any more
 uhhuh
 wow there there's no place in- inside the building wow e  t  p  f  l  is a c-   it's a nonsmoking campus but there are some places tha-
   yeah yeah yeah  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 w- what abou- what about the the the cafeteria i mean we are going to purchase a cafeteria with a projector and all this altogether or reading room yeah it's altogether
 so in the living room
 bu- i ju- just before finishing uh i mean we have a cafeteria or we don't eat at all
 a place n- what um uh we can take a coffee also
 no
  
 but they close at five or ah okay
 okay okay
 yeah yeah this
 ah that's the main problem  
  
 okay
  
 yes i ha- i have no constraints so it's fine  
 and don't forget the
 i have a copy yeah
 two
 six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen
 do we really need that
 okay
 yeah
 yeah
 and if we don't get this space then what happens
 these yeah
 okay
 yeah why didn't we have a meeting together
 well certainly we have to ask uh pierrette and uh and maggie since they're not here because they also have a lot of students that they have to see as we do and so that's another consideration too
 oh great
 ye- um before um talking more about individual preferences is there any possibility what they have done in the uh faculty of law for example that they actually split rooms and so we would take uh uh one of the two people rooms and split it and you would see that you would have the same size office but that would give the privacy um insofar as in just about every other faculty in the building every professor has their own office and it's it's really it goes a bit far that uh we have to have this uh all this sharing uh so one option and that but that we would need to ask about if we could uh split one of the rooms uh
 that doesn't really solve it uh
 i mean there's there's really a difference to having to have your own yeah and sometimes you have uh you need to have private uh discussions with somebody or whatever so
 well i i think it's uh really a matter of personal preference as you know um i prefer to have uh my own office um i also have uh a lot of phone calls and y- you know have to see people and with the other work that i'm doing with the rectorate uh that is really confidential information that i'm treating so i that i have to be really careful about too but it's a personal preference uh insofar as what we've had up until now both maggie and pierrette have been happy to share with others so i mean i think that we should still check with them
 well not sharing with each other they each share with an assistant yeah
 paid on that
 uhhuh
 yeah and also some of our the people mentioned here are working on more than one project too so
 for example uh marianne de- uh she's also working with me on the virtual campus project so she that one wasn't mentioned but i'm not saying that i necessarily want to be with her in the office but uh it's just to say people are working on uh sometimes more than one project uh
 yeah
 yep
 well yeah we'll skip that for now   no i d- um the lounge okay but i think we need to also see it as a overflow place when we have um uh visitors for any length of time so they actually have a place to work
 no you want to have visitors yeah
 yeah
 yes but we have more space here than what we currently have so it's at least some
  
 uhhuh
 no
 no because they can share their ideas across the project yeah i would say
  
 no and if you look now at their uh the the current division of the offices for example uh bruno and agnes are sharing an office and they're working on totally different projects and and they're they're just fine with that
  
 well there there were but they sort of disappeared as of october when the no smoking rule came in because before we were grouping the smokers and now that there's no smoking uh i guess that's not very important option though
 well except for that maybe you don't even want anybody smoking on your balcony so  
 no
 no n- it's in in principle it's a it's a no smoking building you can smoke outside so you can go outside onto the balcony to smoke not even in the cafeteria no
 full no smoking building for all of the six thousand students
 yeah yep
 there is the there's that terrace
 no
  
 the other way
 no we we do have one constraint that's difficult which is uh gisella because when she's there she's very noisy
 she's on the phone a lot it's just it's by yeah it's by nat- uh by the nature of her work that uh a lot of it is communication yeah
 yep
   i think that's a excellent idea why don't we ask about that
 i mean there is certainly enough space uh down the hall wi- if all of those uh uh offices that are where half of them are also half time and they're very underused so um
   and pierrette too
 yeah with with younger people yeah
 no
 so   we we invite invite and then we say okay you can sit with gisella  
  
 um
 except for in every other faculty
 yes it is so every other faculty as far as i have seen their offices and the people that i know and that's in um in law
 uh socio economics uh okay it's a they all have their own office i mean in in the in the law faculty they're at best there half time
 we're going to have to
  
  
 okay i'll ask um uh maggie and pierrette uh if they have uh any preferences
 yeah
 no
 yeah since they're not at the meeting i think it's in out of courtesy we should first ask them
 he means reading room
 no coffee machines
 no there's the cafeteria is downstairs but they close at five
 yeah but there's the two machines and they're uh the vending machines where you just put the money and and you can get yeah yeah
 wait
 wait wait tuesday um
 ch-
   um we have the don't forget we have the other meeting the m  d  m  meeting in the morning so it would have to be in the afternoon
 yeah exactly
 yeah
 at nine thirty but we could do we could have this meeting then in the afternoon nah
 yep okay yeah okay
  
 okay
 oh yeah
 andre just yeah just a a clarification question are they number of people per room indicated strict or can we play around with i mean if there are two people is it really that you can't put three or uh two and a half or uh how how was it calculated
 okay
 uhhuh
 i have everything
 okay so
 are you sure of that
 uhhuh
 yeah but counting the rea- the the reading room
 uhhuh
 and susan don't forget the time we spend to for discussions about that room so you should be able to valorize this if possible
 but i still agree with you that the b- the we are not so we are not so large as far as space is concerned uh because fifteen people to put in there eighteen positions so uh to the best uh if you take uh two people room for the reading room then you have uh sixteen places um
 yeah that that also means that the growth will be zero
 visiting visiti- visiting researchers students coming for exchange students et cetera
 we j- we stay where we are
 no the the the chances might be that there are more people to put in that space
 andre sorry for interrupting but uh one again clarification question what is the real margin of maneuver that we have for these discussions because uh at least we are half per cent uh fifty per cent of from e  p  f  l  and uh sometimes you have meetings where w- y- the the decision is already taken so uh um you can spend quite a lot of time discussing things so what what will be the impact of what we will come out come up with
 so another way of a-
 another way of asking the question is there any other group already working on uh on the how this should be uh should be allocated or are we the the one that is supposed to do the p- the the p- position for it
 but wha- why why don't they have any representative here i mean  
 yeah why do we do it separately
 okay
 no but you know that that's a standard thing it's suppose that somebody for some strange reasons want to be in the corner and we don't know about that we'll put them put her or him somewhere else then we will do plenty of work for nothing because we'll not have this constraint we'll not be aware of this constraint
 oh okay
 okay
 yeah
 yeah
 i agree with that that's
 whe- whe- where parttime is important is that it's n- an overlo- load on a room so um for sure if you have a parttime person it reduces the the ranges of time where too many people in the room as far as i am concerned i probably might be able to have a kind of a regular presence here um the uh the thing that f- in my case has to be taken into account is that i will have a lot of phone calls so i'll be talking o- o- o- over the phone all the time so that's not necessary well it depends on i i have nothing against sharing a a an office with somebody i d- already did it before so and it was perfectly fine
 it just has to be somebody who can work while somebody else is having phone calls in the in the room which is very d- much dependent on people some people are not disturb at all by this some people just can't work
 i'm not but uh and uh what might happen but it uh it will not be so heavy here uh at issco is visitors so that i will have more at e  p  f  l  uh typically students coming in um or asking for things as i'm not teaching here i'm teaching at e  p  f  l  this should shouldn't be a such a big load
 so for me it it will be essentially i will not be i will not be able to be silent in the room because i will be communicating also through vocal means so
 hmm
 yeah
 hmm
 do you go for boxes for instance in the in the bigger rooms where yeah you know like uh cubicles yeah
 hmm
 you mean you really want to have walls
 four walls
 yeah
 yeah sure sure
 uhhuh
 yeah
 hmm
 yeah yeah
 i fully agree with that that's uh it's much easier to me to uh to foresee having two people of the same position sharing a room than uh
 oh sharing with their students oh sorry because but that that's uh it's it's tricky because of confidentiality reasons as you said yeah you you you are discussing a budget on the on the project you over the phone typically you don't necessary want to have somebody who will be dependent on that budget being part of the discussion so
 no
 no because pro- project doesn't last in time they will change
 that's what the only thing that will not or that will change only progressively in time is the status of the people um
 yeah they will promote that  
 but still th- some things well yeah
 yeah
 if if it if i- if projects are what you have in mind i think that uh meeting room is the the tool for that if you need to have people in a projects talking together they just have a meeting room if it's not too far away then then it's a very good good practice
 yes
 that's why i was quite receptive to uh susan's remark at the beginning is   i wouldn't formulate it in a such a an extreme way as do we really need the lounge but uh i would p- probably formulate it in the way that uh do we want to have only a lounge or s- something that can be used only as a reading room
 because because meeting rooms to me are very important tools to do uh collaborative work
 but on the other hand we also have to relax so that's
 yes
 yes
 yeah
 yeah
 because that's really my one of my worries with the plan that we have here is that it's it pr- provides no possible possibilities of expansion
 and this will happen i mean you can't you can't prevent having visitors   and you shouldn't
 which for for fifteen people it's not enough i mean uh
 yeah it's we have we have four professors here and and and two researchers
 um
 it's bad it's bad
  
 because this is really related with security uh regulation as well i mean you can't just put walls in in rooms without any specific authoris- yeah uh it's not necessary heavy in terms of work it's heavy in terms of administrative authorization
 at least at e  p  f  l 
 i think so if you organize the desks in a in a intelligent way
 yep
 yeah right that's the point
 no
 coffee machines are that made for that
 no that's that's proximity doesn't play a big role there we can discuss with people that the the space is very small i mean altogether it's
 and uh you don't y- you don't need to discuss about the projects you f- more need about th- to discuss about where is the printer how do i get furniture i'm i don't have a a pencil where is the the box with the pencils and so on this is not project related
 yeah
 yeah that's true
 no
 it's nonsmoking campus
 not even in the cafeteria downstairs
 okay
 wow
   on the roof maybe
 the balcony okay
 but andre uh just a
 still some places where smokers can survive but andre just a comment abou- about your your previous uh request i i don't think that anyone will provide you information such as who doesn't want to be with whom that's a typical uh   output of ex- uh research in expert systems these are the rules that you never get but uh you can get them through a proposal so you propose a setup where people are with other peoples and they will find politically correct ways to tell you that uh they don't want to have a view on the mountains but they prefer to have view on the old town so they would be in the toilets   they would um p- prefer to be in another room
 yeah
 yeah
 but that's a sec- s- that's the admin that's the admin uh so it's part of the work yeah
 and that that's a problem you're right because because we don't have a one person we d- we don't have enough one person rooms for uh accommodating the uh the admin place and uh if you put two person persons or three persons for the admin space who who who else would you put in there
 because we don't have any assistant manager or we don't have we have only one half part halftime uh admin and no other non researcher positions if i'm not mistaken and this is really a piece of a problem maybe you could put some visitors but um
 i know it's not very uh realistic in a in a in an admin room but uh
 yeah because
 you can't put a researcher there that's just either you lose one position or you find another admin or assistant manager
 yeah
  
 yep
 no that's not sure that's not sure uh the- there are to me there are two options possible is either you we can take one of the one person rooms for the admin because some of typically the professors have good reasons for sharing sharing either with a colleague or sharing uh with some of their uh one of their p  h  d  students in that case it's it's realistic then we could very very simply uh allocate the one pers- one of the one person rooms for the admin and that would solve the problem the other thing is to take a two person room for the admin that could be the one uh close to the uh close to the here in the center so uh the yeah
 but tha- no no no the other one the the one op- yeah here this one but then uh that   the the question of what do we do with the second position there remains fully open
 so i would be i would be more of the opinion to to see whether it's it's so evident that let's say the at least the two full fulltime professors that are here on the list we have one here but uh maggie is is not present if they really
 yeah and pierrette if if if   because of personal preferences they would be happy with a two person room which might or might not be the case i mean it's it's certainly not uh something that we should impose but we can ask
 yeah but that's not realistic either i mean you have you have a fore- foreign researcher coming visiting you and you will put put him in the admin office
 uh you'll not do that i mean uh maybe you can do that with an exchange student that's
 but you can't take a senior visitor and uh   him in the in the secretary
   uh you're here  
 as susan said p-
   yeah is that so
 oh
 yeah
 okay
 no no that's it
 as we said it's it's really a matter of personal preference it cannot be something else it cannot be imposed for sure it's uh
 job
 again uh uh um andre i think that the only realistic way we can do is to speak for our for ourselves i can tell you according to what i know now where i would like or would be ready to be but i really don't see how i could decide for uh maggie or pierrette or whoever else on the list that they should be there
 yeah b- why why couldn't we do like couldn't we do it like for for the the setup of meetings you you   everyone received that and uh should provide yeah i would like to be here and then you will have this multi constraint problem and uh you work during two hours and you come up with the optimal solution
 yeah i would i would ask for their place i mean that's that's that's the important thing you want to know
 uh it's a reading room
 reading room it's not a cafeteria
 but that that's an open question whether it's a it's a it's a it at the origin it was supposed to be a f- pure reading room for relaxing uh reading the newspapers et cetera et cetera uh there has been a very long discussion about that i stinct- uh this discussion is still vivid that some of the people i bel- belong to these people would like to have a mixed room where you can have a reading room for sure but also meeting room if necessary or as uh susan said a room an emergency room where you can put uh some visitors in a decent environment for for for for work because you don't have any other place to do it but that's that's really an open discussion and that d- i think no decision no final decision has been taken about that
 yes
 yes
   the one that i don't want to have in the next room  
  
 okay
 okay
 that would be great that would be great
 c- that that of course is one of the main well not main but one of the important features that we need to know about
 yes
 yes
 we don't have cafeteria
 no there is no coffee in the reading room
 that was the wrong we   we did not have any money for buying the coffee machines so
 five
 and you can bring your coffee in the reading room
 t- to try the coffee  
 wait wai- wai- wai- wait next tuesday
 uh well well well well not so easy uh
 next tuesday we have a meeting yeah that might be where is the meeting it's unimail
 okay so yeah yeah then it could be that
 that yeah that that would be great because that would allow us not to move or not to travel twice
 yeah after lunch right yep okay
 thank you
 hey look these are microphones they uh they're for women's shirts
 um okay   so um   let's start
 um thanks for coming again to this meeting i hope it won't be too long and especially that we'll make some progress on uh this uh on this small task that is putting people in our new rooms uh i hope you had fun in uh well designing something or uh asking the people about their preferences and uh things like this so yeah that's what i was talking about it's for women's shirts um   so um well i think you remember all the constraints and the new settings i think you'll be more and more used to it as as soon as we move so we have these one person two person and three person rooms um and so that makes i think eighteen places   and we had about fifteen people and some uh spare uh spare um well working places to to put um may i first uh provide the answers to the the questions from the last time
 oh great yeah so that will be part of the your uh your solution or suggestions to solution but regarding the constraints um there is no immediate plan to to make separations between the rooms so that means basically well we have to do with this setting and uh   it's it's quite difficult to make new doors and new walls so i think we shouldn't count on them in the next uh four years maybe and they don't want us to sh- i mean they don't want to provide an extra working   space for gisella with the other i  t  admins which we could understand because it's sort of full over there but uh at least that's what they said
 so it seems we uh   yeah the   well we cannot change the habits of the whole school just for us though it wouldn't be a bad thing maybe but uh   we'll see so regarding the possibility to put four people in one of the two uh three person rooms um well it's not very easy we'll have to play uh quite uh quite wisely with the furnishing it it looks like it's not impossible at least on the one that is a bit uh longer on on the right so uh the one uh here it should be possible to put four persons if we could avoid it it would much simplify things but uh well we'll see
 no no no no
 yeah i think yeah it it's more a matter of how to arrange the furniture but uh since we are experts at this task uh okay so maybe we could count on on four places but the final decision is not really ours so uh we'll see actually   this
 exactly or one of the intern positions the people who might come or something like that um okay so these were the um   the answers so actually i i did my uh my proposal as a slide would you like me to start or would you like me to end it's uh
 oh great
 beautiful okay then let me um explain very briefly the the rationale for for this so it's the same uh schema that you know in red you have the uh uh oh excuse me that's quite uh annoying excuse me um hello
 oh yeah um can i can i call you a bit later in about half an hour i'm just in the middle of a meeting and i'm talking
 oh okay thank you bye bye um sorry for this   fortunately we were just uh the four of us um   okay so let me get back to into the proposal after the brief interruption um so the names are in red now um well one of the reasons at least for me for doing this was to more or less group people uh with within projects because i i think that sometimes they ju- they just discuss together and uh it's easier if they are in the same office
 and um which is quite happy actually i i also thought that some professors might enjoy or at least uh don't don't say anything about being with their assistants so i was happy to hear susan uh saying that maggie and bruno could well together and pierrette and uh marianne in in the same office
 um so what i can say is uh that   i also understood that susan would be rather in favor of uh well having her own office so uh it's it's it's working like this i put the lounge in the middle it's also one of the rooms with the fewer uh the fewest uh windows so i think that's not a problem because you're not going to just stay there and stare outside uh but it's it's nicer to have a nicer view from your office i guess i don't know yeah maybe i thought in an angle but that's obviously not very
 yeah okay and so next to the photocopy maybe it wouldn't be a bad place here okay
 yeah we'll have to check tha- yeah but the printer is quite small if we fi- find just a small table for it maybe one day we'll have a photocopy that is also a printer so okay but uh i wouldn't well insist on this i think okay so the printer well we'll remove it if we work from this uh this solution so uh i  m 'two is more or less in the upper left side um i said more or less um uh upper uh lower left side uh you have swisstra and so the two projects from the list and then on the on the right side
 maybe not a ver- a very good solution for gisella if you can suggest something uh better because she's with two people who uh well two p  h  d  students and it's true that she has yeah a lot of phone calls to make but um it's some way to to solve some constraints i think this is a very open thing uh if you want we can use this document or we could just say first listen to your suggestions and see if we erase everything or just do some modifications using this one
  
 um yeah maybe not a very strong one then they maybe you are you have better suggestions um it was i think sort of one of the uh places they re- that remain and i i think yeah there is no strong constraint and uh well she's a smoker but the policy is that we don't smoke so it's even better if she's uh with a second person
 uhhuh okay
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah um yeah that was the case and uh she was a bit uh reluctant but
 uhhuh
 yeah we could store files there and things like that uhhuh
 okay so if you want i can already do this change here
 sorry you're
 um
 uhhuh
 yeah th- yeah th- when the printer is yeah it's it's the main one we have a secondary one which we could try to accommodate in another room but it's basically yeah the peop- the the printer where everybody prints um so i change this
 so maybe i would suggest   let me le- k- can i hear also let us hear from you and then if we can work out a solu- a common solution from this one then we go back to to this slide and if not um we'll just well start from scratch um
 uhhuh okay
 yeah
 yeah i'll try i'll bring my walkman and uh
  
 yeah uh david you had also uh what's
 ah
 uhhuh oh let me put the plan sorry i will display uh yeah this is the empty one i don't want to influence you so so you would put uh
 yeah
 yeah
 uhhuh you can you can even stand and just show us there
 okay so we would prefer the names okay i i don't want to influence you too much but uh um i'm perfectly happy to start with this as the basis and then change things
 yeah maybe in different just
 uhhuh oh
 uhhuh or actually pierrette is a woman too yeah it's the feminine of pierre
 uhhuh
   bad
 yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah and for me it's also uh i would prefer maybe not to be in a three person office just to be a bit calmer and martin so i'm very happy with you since i proposed it   but i could also be happy with most of the other people so even in a three person room it's it's fine okay so let's keep in mind maybe this uh constraint of balancing the the genders   uh we'll see if we can uh do something for it
 uh i've asked some of them and i've also used a little bit uh what i've well i mean the the present arrangement just not to to shock people too much and it's also people that i know um get on well quite quite well together and also work on the same project like for instance marianne uh uh the finnish marianne and uh nikos who interact quite a lot on uh on um yeah maria and yalina seem uh to go on one quite quite well
 uh nancy had no strong preference specially since she's no longer allowed to smoke in in her office um yeah so i think well at least as far as i i asked there was no major objection
 um
 yeah that's true that's true i um   so we could put nancy with david and uh put agnes yeah
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah that's a small advantage and uh i it's a bit more uh more comfortable actually um
 uhhuh
 yeah maybe
 uhhuh
 yeah very good uhhuh
 uhhuh yeah probably
 uhhuh
 yeah
 so agnes has worked
 uhhuh they they have worked together on so this makes some sense um at yeah i mean
 yeah as far as i know i think it's probably quite a good uh uh good match
 first one should be maria but it's still uh one and a half okay let's switch uh
 uhhuh yeah
 uhhuh
 i'll just uh
 yeah um yeah i i don't think
 yeah so s- s- okay so since we are supposed to do a final proposal sorry uh let me move the printer um   next to the photocopier
 okay and we'll find some way to um well attach it to a wall or something like this
 yeah i think so yeah   um okay so that's the uh uhhuh uh i don't think we can put visitors in the lounge it's uh
 yeah yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah
 it's
 uhhuh
 how
 how would it be to put the lounge in one of the smaller offices like in well in in one of the one person offices w- i i know they are actually quite uh quite demanded so um i th- i think susan you are very happy with this solution so   okay in gisell-
  
 yeah it's probably too small okay yeah doesn't work um
 uhhuh
 okay let's be innovative um
 uhhuh but the problem is it it has been decided by everyone and approved by the school that we we need the lounge so i i think it's simply not
   no actually uh i i'm sorry it's uh yeah uhhuh
 oh okay so so how do we split the room
 this one uhhuh
 uhhuh so
 yeah but what about if people want to have a small discussion in the lounge
 well not the newspapers because no scientific articles
 journals
 uhhuh yeah
 so you would like to put it yeah within yeah and then who who yeah
 yeah yeah okay but then that means that we'll put the lounge on the right side uh here and uh here we'll put two places for visitors three but that means the office will be at least for the moment empty that looks very bad
 okay so that could take the the free place over there uh i mean
 yeah i think okay so we need what two three positions and one new   person arriving x  or something like that
 okay
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 and and where is the lounge
 no okay   no way i'll i'll have my head cut off if we don't have a lounge so uh
 no no no no let's do the lounge corner okay at least i mean otherwise i cannot really defend it because it it was agreed and we cannot just come back on every every decision we made
 yeah i think so yeah
 okay
 well let's have the visitors first okay so what we need is a new and two so
 i think we can put what maria or yalina i don't want to separate them really but uh
 oh mysel- i don't like that office actually um so i was thinking to put here
 yeah now so it's either
 y- we could put the visitor with you martin but it's probably okay let's try le- let's try this uh let's try maria here oh you don't mind
 perfect
 no no we'll put a visitor place in there
 if you don't mind
 uh i think it's paola
 yeah
 um
 yeah could be
 if
 yeah uhhuh
 no i i would prefer you i think
 okay let me keep you
 okay we'll put paola and a visitor here
 so paola is the new person
 and a visitor uh vis is that vis one and then we'll we'll still have probably some way to put a second visitor here vis two
 oops
 sorry it's not very nice but
 does this display better
 i think it's not bad
 yeah don't put her alone uhhuh
 yeah
 yeah no but we said that we won't discuss or maybe if we organize some kind of you know coffee at the end of the day or a drink then the two people will stop working i don't know maybe they won't be happy okay then martin let let me put you in that office and i'll put paola with me no
 so martin goes where
 yeah
 okay
 yeah okay
 yeah that's true okay so let's put maria in the separate office
 and we have paola
 oh sorry what were you thinking
 so who is with maria here okay
 yeah and no visitor
 yeah but that means that this room the middle one would be quite empty all the i mean two visitors and the fifty per cent pers- person i don't think it's very uh reasonable
 yeah but let's split them a little bit so that when there are no visitors at least people are
 yeah i think so
 so this goes here goes visitor two paola is there here goes visitor one and is this better
 except that we cannot read it but
 apart from this
 uhhuh
 yeah okay let me call this visitor one which implies that uh it will be the first one occupied by a visitor when they come and this visitor two which means it's like a well you know second uh second chance
 or we could what would this change
 uhhuh
 oh yeah very good
 yeah so maybe in the long run we'll get a wall
 uhhuh al- although there are three windows but um okay so where would we move david to maria da- with maria do you have any preferences david um
 well he already is mixed so yeah
 yeah
 yeah i wouldn't put the two visitors in the same room because when there is no one it makes a big hole and when there are two people so it makes too many variations but
 yeah
 uhhuh
 you prefer that too susan okay
 okay
 oops sorry uh what did we say here this one
 yeah my uh
 okay
 well i think that was really decided and it's it's no we no because actually if we do a proposal without a lounge and you know the other group will
 yeah exactly and that means that all the constraints that we said and uh   all the other things just   we- we- well just basically disappear
 uhhuh which means we've worked for nothing okay uh what's what's wrong with this
 okay
 uh i don't oh you have to go susan okay
 yeah well we are almost done susan but uh we we'll we'll just check the the items yeah please okay no problem
 yeah we we'll just review the items to see is we   look at all the constraints and then you'll be able to say the final uh yes or no um
 yeah uhhuh
 yeah i think that's okay yeah we checked uh
 i don't think so no
 uhhuh
 yeah that's a bit yeah that was the point in letting david there and but okay maybe we'll just leave it as an option david or visitor one or two it's uh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah uhhuh
 okay so we'll know that uh that the region actually around here is probably movable yeah either yeah we can switch maria or paola or david yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah no exactly yeah tha- tha-   yeah that's why i always   try to put the to separate the visitors just to balance a little bit but okay we'll uh we'll be open on on that point
 yeah it will become
 uhhuh or it depends also on well if yalina stays longer or not which is not yet very clear but um
 okay w- we'll see anyway we'll we'll be open
 um i don't really know i think her master thesis is probably due um no i would say yeah maybe june next year at the latest yeah   actually i don't know unfortunately
 well we we won't have any extra meeting well the four of us so yeah this one has to to be the the final one um so um we'll we'll have actually i i'll present this to well with the other i'll compare it with the other one and uh try to make a decision actually i think it's even uh a bit later or in two days or something like this
 again okay we- yeah uhhuh
 yeah w- we can leave it like this and then  
 uh yeah there will be names on the doors
 so she'll be a visitor
 uhhuh
  
 okay yeah we'll we'll keep it like this um okay i well i'll try to to express all these constraints and uh and say in particular that the two rooms over here actually are sort of uh well s- things could be changed over there but on some other sides
 yeah the visitor space yeah i'll uh
 uhhuh
   yeah uh that's true and
 well
 i think this i i'm not very sure but i think this will be done after the meeting when okay
 yeah uhhuh
 uhhuh a- as far as know i think agnes is also taking care of a proposal so okay yeah i'll circulate this perfect
 yeah exactly
 okay so maybe we'll learn some more constraints um okay um yeah actually as i as i told uh martin um well this is the last time we meet so uh this is well more or less our proposal and uh we'll have a meeting i think it's uh it's in two days or something like that uh to discuss and compare with the other proposal and uh well make a final decision actually probably a pre final one since we'll have to check again with everyone but uh
 uhhuh
 yeah
 uhhuh well so actually i think i i'm not very sure but the most important thing is well finding out when we will move and this happens in probably i think next month or depends also on how well the uh the furnishing and uh well goes on
   no
 um
 oh no no no no the roo- the the building is very no actually i've seen it uh the building is very modern and uh you can have actually we'll get them activated yeah a- and i think you get at least th- yeah three per room so uh or probably more than that
 okay
 okay
 yeah sometimes he needs two two computers yeah no this this
 hmm
 oh no unfortunately that's decided by the uh the school so the the chairs are blue the the desk is uh is brow- well light brown and uh
 uh normally it's done automatically except that we'll have to think
 yeah uh well these are dictated by the names uh it's probably more difficult for the lounge what we'll have is have a bit less furniture in the lounge and then bring all the well the old it's not old because we just bought it but uh all the furniture from the previous lounge we'll we'll bring it here uh
 well it's the faculty that will take care of uh
 yeah yeah i think yeah i- i mean it's a completely different issue from uh you know arranging people it's just uh how the moving will take place and there are things to to take care of but uh it's uh quite unrelated with these things yeah we'll get uh we'll get all the information uh thinking about internet connections i think it's quite okay for the the for the the printer to be there yeah i think it's i- it's feasible we'll we'll check so the   the violet box here is uh uh our mailboxes also
 um not at the sixth floor yeah yeah no- not not in the building for the moment
 i mean not at this
 uhhuh
 uhhuh   okay well i think it's a bit off topic already so um let's say that i- it's a proposal we'll try it i'm well i'll try to to express the the constraints and uh your opinions and uh well i think finally everyone can veto something if there is a huge problem but i think with this we we don't run into huge problems
 yeah obviously so let me save this
 and thank you for spending all this time
 hope you're all happy
  
  
 that would be fine if one of the person is fifty per cent so me for example
 please
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 because the professors uh you have personal printer or there is only one printer
 because if not the person the printer can go in a room of three people
 that's typical of case where there's the lab and there's   the printer is there
  
  
  
 yeah okay for me uh as uh i don't know l- uh the people a lot uh you suggested that uh there's a la- a lack of men   s- so i would re- certainly put uh not two men in the same office i would try to share them   with the women so uh for example in your slide i could uh switch either you or martin with uh uh the other room this one
 so
 yes please
 yeah yeah i was wanting to change this wa-
 uhhuh
   yeah but i need your uh your slide because i was talking about your slide
 yes so here you can see that the the   the men is i mean they are always sh- sharing the room with a g- with a woman i mean there's bruno me uh pierrette and nikos is a guy also
 oh   sorry for this
 uhhuh so i mean this is perfectly fine i will just send martin and andrei for maria or or yalina or nancy maybe
 so
 yeah here there are two men so i mea-   yeah i it's nice i don't think i mean there's a lack of men here in in in this   in this lab so i would change one switch one
  
  
 but we agree that it's not important to to share the room with someone that has the same project  
 quite happy to have the the full room some fifty per cent of the time
  
  
 is there anyone that is going to finish p  h  d  or or leave or
  
  
  
  
 no but a lounge in a one person room is really too small
  
 no no i don't think we can choose
  
  
  
 no
 let's put m- maria or yalina in the in the in this place
 no lounge
  
  
  
  
  
  
 well the the lounge can not be in here t- with two people i mean you cannot go there and discuss and and two people working there in the room
  
   sure not me  
   that's true  
  
  
 uh it's completely fine
   then uh the two visitors will be in one room but doesn't that's fine because maybe there are not two visitors at the same time uh we'll see
 one
  
  
  
  
  
 yeah yeah you need because sometimes you need a laptop and
  
  
 so you agree with a lounge
  
 no no it's the opposite
   and i also checked with uh maggie and pierrette
 great
 come now it's not full over there  
 no uh no and and i and i went over and i looked at that room too there's plenty of space for four people
 yeah
 ah  
 exactly yeah
 um well just t- just to uh uh complete uh i talked both with maggie and pierrette and both of them are happy to share offices they have no problem whatsoever
 uh they're they're easy but uh could be uh as pierrette has right now that she cou- she is happy to continue to share with uh marianne uh and and maggie for example to share with uh it could be with bruno because they work on the swisstra together and they like to gossip together so
  
 people who don't turn off their phone in a meeting it's fantastic
  
 yeah
 yes  
 no yeah
 yeah why not put the printer out in the hallway
 it is there enough space there for a photocopy and printer
 the photocopy is a bit big
 well i've a question what's the justification for giving nancy her own office
 um doesn't help yeah
 well gisella will   not be very happy about that uh we tried that and gisella really didn't like to have a printer and people in and out all the time and uh
 uh remember andrei that was uh yeah yeah
 lot's of phone calls yeah
   earplugs uh whatever  
 so yeah you have to show us which one you were talking about david we didn't
 ah the center room
 uh he wants to mix sexes
  
 andrei did you ask these people if this was okay with them
 yes
 yeah but agnes is also working with david so
 yeah but there's
 yeah but that doesn't mat- that's not important
 there w- one question i was wondering about though because three is always uh well the more people in a office uh the less ideal that wouldn't it maybe be better to put david in since he's only halftime so that way then
 there's not three people all the time
 yeah
 uh no uh maria is maria is the closest but she's still not uh uh yeah
  
 no because don't forget we already have somebody coming in uh january
 at least one person
 yeah or we make four space in the three people rooom
 yeah
 yes yes  
   that's an excellent idea  
 it's too small for a uh yeah
 we put it the the furniture that we got for our reading room we put it into the other half of the three person room
   would that fit
 a little divider of some kind
 well not just newspapers
 but also to read articles
 uhhuh
 it's not a visitor it's a a new p- p- fulltime person arriving in january
 no that's where we're going to put the lounge  
 well for
 no no no no we we have to
 yeah yeah yeah
   no there's no space   the lounge is in the free space
 after all that we went through to get the budget for it we really have to uh
  
   no wait a minute yeah
 no we are not going to keep marianne in a three uh person place uh just having marianne in the lounge yeah
  
  
  
  
 but wait a minute then andrei has a two person office all for himself  
 yeah
 wha- what's what's her name again andrei
 paola
 okay martin goes back to andrei
 um paola well paola being new i i think it would be better to put her with somebody else
 no no put why not maria or yalina
 martin stays maria's
 well we have
 uh yeah
 no the rooms have to look like they're sort of occupied uh oterwise we might uh lose room or two
  
 this is always the game  
 no but but look martin it's quite a long room it has two doors
  
 yeah the occupancy is better that way
 because there is regular there is regular occupancy yeah
 we won't be very credible
 i'll be right back
 i i just need to see somebody
 sorry yeah
 no because there is another person right now a student that i just uh um hired and she's just working right now for uh
 for november and december yeah
 a- she uh she's a she's a real visitor she's a real visitor that i just made a contract for her for two months yeah
 what's the timeline on this now so you have a meeting when
 uhhuh oh yeah
 how many connections are there per room
 no get the uh for the the bigger rooms you get double for every workplace you get two lines
 yeah
 yeah
 no because lots of people have you know they have a sun and they have a a pc so
  
 well we have to say how many places that we want to have
 yeah they'll just give us a date when
 the well there is downstairs in the building and pretty soon the whole building will be covered yeah
 yeah but right now in uh downstairs it's fine some people can pick it up on sixth floor but pretty soon the whole building will be covered
 yeah okay
 yeah
 the the question is is it is it against the regulation security regulation of the school that's that's the important point
 okay
  
 uhhuh
 okay okay
 yes that looks good
 people sh- yeah that's
 let me check that i   i di- i didn't s-
 yeah but putting the printer in the lounge is just killing the lounge
 it's not a question where it is it's a question of you are printing all the time so
 uh
 yeah that's that's a possible  
 yeah why not
 uh i would have i would have a provocative suggestion to put gisella to switch nancy and gisella
 put gisella the fax and the printing machine the printer in the one person room as a as a
 okay so the printer that's that's not the s- not the hard constraint but uh
 because i really do think it's important to have
 an admin room clearly identified as an admin room and only an admin room where you have files where yeah you can close it you have the personal files of the of the people of the of the of the unit etcetera etcetera
 so for instance i be fully against the fact that my personal files are in f- in a in a room that is not specifically dedicated for that
 printer can be in the in the in the corridor that's uh that's uh that's perfectly alright
 i'm perfectly alright to share the room with you has a view on the old town that's um
 you have to be aware of what i was saying last time was that you have to suffer some suffer from fro- from phone calls
 so if you have a walkman that's   that's good
  
 yeah because there are plenty of things that are that are okay so uh
 yeah but for pierrette an- and maggie it's uh it's
 it's a wish or it's uh it's because they
 i didn't get your solution what was it again
 so
 ah okay
 but that's not so much a question of uh men or women it's more the question of as i said that's uh
 um here you have only p  you have p  h  d  students that are a group there you have s- senior researchers that are a group which is to me more
 unless it corresponds to some specific demand like it is in the case in maggie maggie's case and pierrette's case i think that's a very efficient way of doing things because
 yeah um i'm perfectly happy with with andrei so  
 sure but um
 but isn't there just a a a question of proximity you put david with agnes
 um but isn't agnes working
 um in a   in a more substantial way in uh with people like uh either maria or yalina
 because
 yeah yeah i i know
 no that's true that's true the other constraints are are satisfied somehow so
 no but what i mean it was was the three the two three person rooms i think that they can mix them the way they want i mean if they prefer to be uh maria tha- uh yalina and nikos and nancy and marianne on the other side well no that's not completely equivalent because nancy all are p  h  d  students or masters students but nancy correct
 oh
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah so i would switch david and nancy typically
 which doesn't mean that david should be in this room he could be in the other one for me uh the two three people rooms are really they have to be uh re shuffled according to people personal preferences but i definitely would put uh nancy with agnes in the two person room
 yeah
 but again it's also a question of personal preference i mean you you can't be in a room with person you don't want to be with  
 i see if you do it this way you mean that in the two three people room there will be one that is not so overloaded because of david because david will be part time and the other one not so overloaded because there is uh one free position uh knowing that this one free position uh will not stay free very long  
 yes so
 and this is still a worry for me because we are still we don't still still don't have enough space for the visitors
 unless we put them in the lounge
 therefore i w-
 yeah yeah
 we need to have at least three visitors' position because positions because
 outside
 yeah
   so that we keep it you mean
 it depends it depends on how we think about the lounge if it's thought as being a reading room no if it's thought as the que- that that's really a very important question to me do we do we put priority on the fact of being able to read newspapers in our in our offices or in our uh work place we can read newspapers elsewhere
 and i really do think it's more important for lab to be able to decently uh welcome visitors that come to the lab than to have a place for reading newspapers newspapers you can read them home know we can go to the cafeteria or you can sit somewhere else you can go on the balcony if it's if it's in the summer so i i don't understand why we why we should put priority on lounges if we if we don't have enough space for accommodating visitors that's just not not according to my priorities
  
 s- so let's let's put the lounge in susan's office and susan's in susan in the lounge with three visitors um  
 i would advocate to just remove the lounge we it's a luxury for us we don't have space for a lounge it's let's be you you cannot you cannot go at the at the at the at the in front of your colleagues and saying i p- if i have to choose between uh reading my newspaper and disc- and having a a decently welcomed uh v- uh research visitor i prefer to read my newspaper that's just not that's just not realistic i mean we are researchers
 but then
 then you have the three people room that positions split it in two parts as as susan was was uh proposing last time was a ha- was a wall and you have a lounge there can read your newspapers and we have a full two room two person room where we can certainly accommodate three visitors and at least we have some uh free margin for the next two years or the next year
 the the three people over there
 yeah and put uh uh um
 they are not supposed to have a discussion in the lounge they are supposed to read their newspapers
 and to drink their coffee
 uh scientific articles no that's not that wasn't the goal the the goal of the lounge was was a place where you can relax
 you can do it in your office
 it's it's it's you have a good chairs to read newspapers that you don't want to break you heart your your your your back your office
 yes
 yes
 three
 no we have our visitor that is arriving uh what did you say susan
 uh okay  
 no no   that could take one one positions in the in the lo- in the
 ah okay that that's an idea if if if if you forget about the lounge   what you could do is to move either mari- maria or yalina in the in the um what is currently the lounge that means that we have one person there with one free position
 we have one free position in the in the room that maria or yalina is coming from and one free position over there so we have three position distributed over the rooms where we can accommodate
 no lounge
 louge
 you take the furniture of the lounge and you put it in the corridor
 you you will explain to your visitors that unfortunately they have a position in the toilet because there is a reading room where people have to relax
 it could be nikos for instance could put you can switch
 but it's a lounge
 yeah but then
 yeah you could   you could put me there i mean andrei
 because i will be there half time and the visitors probably will not so much complain about phone calls
 well there is this fulltime person arriving in i i think it's really important to to plan with that
 would it be possible to have paola in your office
 because that's that's something that we we should be deciding either you want to keep me in your office which is alright and then we have to forsee a place for paola somewhere i i think that's that's not realistic to have a planning  
 why didn-
 yeah
 that's visitor one
 um
 somebody else
 not supposed to discuss you are supposed to relax
 because you don't want to separate ma- maria and yalina why
 because yalina i- it's not even sure she stays it's a master student so uh
 yeah
 and we have yeah and we have two visitors and a masters student and a p- and a parttime person
 i was thinking the other way around  
 to keep paola with maria in the two people room and to have this one with two yalina and david in the three people room
 paola
 no that's a two people room so  
 yep
 no yalina is there david is there
 but you need to have to put visitors somewhere i mean uh
 ah
 oh
 okay
 well
 it's a little bit crowded in
 because you have well not yet of course because paola is not has not arrived but uh starting from january you will have two fulltime person plus one parttime person plus one visitor that's
 okay
 okay
 but why couldn't we basically
 move you david in this two people room with maria
 maria plus one half pa- uh halftime person
 and you have paola yalina one visitor position and i still keep hope that uh marianne nikos that the lounge will on the   on on the   on the long term disappear because anyhow i don't believe there can be a lounge where in a place where there are already two people working so the lounge will just die after some point and it uh it
 still i mean
 ah okay ah it has two doors yeah that's true
 ah yeah but then then yeah okay okay okay that's true okay then then there will be a wall okay
 yeah that's good
 uh she she wa- she wants mixing peo- uh men and women so or she he   yeah right
 yeah that's to me it's more realistic
 yeah but then then you can you can move for instance if you move david to uh with maria
 then
 i think it's it's better first it's better i think it's uh because it's more it's stabler
 because visitors stay and go
 yeah that's good
 to me that's the best we can do
 if you if we realistically can plan to have a lounge
 okay okay okay
 i go- i got the message  
 yes sir
 so who has strong
 strong opposition to that
 but do you have any no  
  
 but it's just a decision no you just have
 okay
 i think we we we accommodated most of the constraints because uh we are sure that maggie and bruno uh maggie is happy with having bruno in her office and pierrette is happy to have uh marianne in her office that's that that checked okay
 and yes and no reason to think that there should be uh uh uh uh an impossible situation
 same thing for marianne and marianne f  and nikos
 uh paola we don't know yet because she didn't arrived yet and uh well yalina aha that means for a for a short time yalina will be just alone in the three person room
 that's a bit a problem
 ah but then then we what we could just for the sake of having a defendable solution uh as long as paola is not has not arrived is to switch for the proposal paola and david
 but we we really plan that as soon as paola is here or even earlier
 david will go to the to the two people room
 it's just it will be switched
 because this this this this is dangerous to propose i mean   you have a three per- three person room with one masters student in it okay   so i wouldn't i wouldn't propose that
 okay
 but as soon as paola is here
 uh it starts to be better and we will have visitors for sure
 yeah right right that's true yeah
 oh yeah that's a point true ah do we have a do do we know do we know when when is she supposed to finish the her uh master thesis in june
 june next year
 okay wha- when when do we when do you when whe- uh when are we supposed to sub- sumbit the proposal
 okay that's now
 okay
 um
 okay
 well so as soon as we have susan we can uh we can um so i would i would switch again
 da- but that as i say it's just for the sake of the of the proposition so i even i'm even ready to uh to internally say that david will actually be in this room
 what does it what does it change names on the doors
 aha so if we because susan the the the the problem the let's say the techn- not the technical the psy- psychological problem we have is pra- i'm   extremenly happy with that solution it would be a workab- work- working solution starting from january when paola will be here but currently if we present it as it is we have a three person room that is only occupied by a masters student
 aha so sh- you have a student that we that's a rea- real visitor to some extent
 ah so this one and this two one are just ah okay okay so then we would have two people there okay
 yeah then that works
 yeah but you you really have also to say that that that a a unit has to has to have some some horizon i mean uh   it's it's it's it's extremely important in the research domain that we can have people coming to visit us
 uh the second point i would suggest is that before you go to defend it you should uh um circulate it uh over mail to all the all the con- involved people
 to double check so that
 i would do it before   because you if you if you spend time defending a thing then um i don't know agnes comes to you or pierrette comes to you saying it no i don't want to be with marianne uh what do you do
 so so it doesn't
 cost anything it's just people will look at it say oh great i have a view on the mountain and i'm uh with a person i like so i'm happy
 because
 yeah   it's it's it's not it's not completely it's an important issue because uh i need to know when i will have the office decided the phone number decided because these are information that i have to provide to administration i'm reachable when i'm at uh well they can phone me on the mobile but uh i would definitely prefer to have a clean filled administrative form that i can give back
 yes yes
 okay
 and then uh of course you have these all these practical issues how about internet connections well uh network connections i mean
 yeah because that's also something double check you know if you are in a room with three people and one network connection  
 well no no um
 okay
 but are they activated
 okay
 okay
 ah okay good that looks good
 and if you go back to the uh to the uh other sli- slide where you have the furniture so with this uh we do we have any m- any any word to say and uh so that i would like to have a red chair or a blue desk uh or a  
 so that's the standard things
 but do we have to order something or is it done automatically so it will be in the office when we move in
 uhhuh
 um
 and how about the boxes because at you have to say when you will be moving the boxes so that you have uh people for moving them or here you're supposed to move them yourself or
 so we'll receive some information about that
 okay
 that's true but uh   right right right okay okay
 yeah that's an important point the the printer needs to be connected  
 by the way uh uh is there any uh wireless connection uh antennas for getting because i i've i've heard that there is one downstairs in the
 that
 but that's important i mean typically for the laptops it's
 ah okay good
 yeah yeah
 um
 sure
 at least the four of us will not veto
   at least
  
 okay
 uh i guess i start with my presentation we had two groups of people working on this so we'll show you two slightly different presentations feel free to ask any questions or comments obviously um the first one was done by myself bruno marianne and nikos and the rationale that we have i'll show you the layout in a second was that full professors would get private offices administration is close to the professors offices so it's easier for the secretary to speak to everyone the fax is in the administration office since it's mostly used by gisella who's the secretary for noise reduction purposes we've moved everyone who has office hours together and we've also put the network printer and the photocopier in the hall um so i'll just show you how that works basically you can see gisella sort of there in the middle with the fax machine and maggie and susan who are the two full professors in our department have the private offices and the photocopier and the printer are sort of in the hall on the side there across from mailboxes
 um just to go back most people are grouped in projects and we have two fifty per cent people who are half time in geneva half time at the e  p  f  l  in lausanne and they m- them we've put in three person offices so that in the three person offices it's not constantly three people so there's a little bit of give there and the reading room or the lounge as some people call it that we have is in a central position so basically we've got andre and nancy at the top um they don't actu- they will be starting a new project together if um if i'm not mistaken like i said susan and maggie in the individual offices nikos and yalina who work on the same project at the bottom the reading room is in the middle um marianne and bruno are at the bottom um as well marianne works closely with pierrette and the other marianne we have two mariannes in our department and david is a half time so as i said the half times are in the three person offices and on the other side we have maria martin and myself who all work on the same project and martin is fifty per cent um gisella we've given her two person office for two reasons one is because there's a spare place there so if we want to put a stagieur or someone who just comes in for short period of time we figured it was okay if they were in the admin office which is a little bit noisy because they're only there for a short period of time um and again the proximity to the other offices um so i guess that's pretty much it for our proposal um i don't know if you want andre to go through his first or if you have any questions for me
 she's it's do you want to explain how it it works or
 martin is fifty per cent pierrette there's two sort of statutes of professor i guess you could say where there's
 yeah
 there's a professeur d'ecole and the
 but the idea is maggie and susan are sort of the senior
 um professors on staff so they got the the individual offices
 um the department will obviously be growing but there are some people who only work part time there's some people who are doing p  h  d 's or master students who won't necessarily be there for a larger extent of time so for example yalina and the finnish marianne are master students for right now so whether they decide to stay and do a p  h  d  we're not sure yet um nikos is working um as a researcher
 so for him it's the same thing there's i think the only constant people are susan maggie andre um gisella pierrette um and all the rest are either p  h  d  students or master students and again martin and david are half time with the e  p  f  l  so
 that's project dependent as well
 unfortunately we haven't been given as much space as we would have liked but that's always the case  
 um susan wanted a private office she has a preference for private offices other than that no one really had any tight constraints from what i've heard
   no one's explicitly said that they needed to avoid anyone else um
 yeah yeah yeah
 no they were fine with it so
 and they're both nice views  
 yeah they're windows yeah
 or sorry the thick lines are windows actually we have fairly big windows in the room yeah so there's lots of light coming in
 and one of the reasons for putting the reading room where it was is that you have a lot of light coming in so if people just go somewhere to sort of relax and
 have a quiet place to sips- sit they have a lot of light and
 yeah yeah
 yeah well i mean it depends if you like looking out over the old town and the cathedral that sort of goes both ways but yeah we've got two mountain views sort of on that side that side and then the last part looks on the old town because we're on the sixth floor you can actually see everything because i don't think buildings are much higher than was it six or eight floors
 yeah
 the purple thing is the mailboxes and those are fixed we can't do anything about those
   so
 um r-
 we don't have anything like that if we can get stuff like that it might be a good idea some people might like them at the moment we have people thre- sharing like three people in a room without any partitions and
 it's a little bit noisy but people sort of get used to it and admittedly it's mostly assistants that are stuck in rooms like that so it's junior people but
 well do you want to do your presentation and
 okay
 so
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah
 uhhuh
 but realistically we don't actually have that many visitors coming in i've been here for almost two years and we've had a couple of stagieurs but that's it
 no for a professor yeah but
 oh in a way if that's your argumentation then put a visiting person with a senior
 researcher at least if not a professor rather than two students
  
   if you're going to argue that the visitors are supposed to be important and they should have their own space then put them with another researcher rather than two students
 fairly regularly there's at least one or two people in there i mean it's a yeah it's a fairly new thing in the department but it's being used pretty regularly or something that a lot of people wanted just sort of quiet space out of your office that doesn't have the office furniture the office chairs it sort of has comfortable sofas and armchairs and things like that where you can just go and relax and or if you want to read something for a longer period of time in a more comfortable environment and because we do a lot of reading and things like that it does get used fairly often
 we sort of have an open policy where if there's no one in there and you want to have a discussion then that's fine but you can't displace people who are in there reading just because you want to have a mini meeting or whatever
 yeah
 yeah they're
 yeah
 which is sort of why in our proposal we had it completely as a separate room so if you really want peace and quiet you shut the door and when the doors are shut like unless someone's making noise right outside the door it really is fairly quiet
 uhhuh
 um
 i mean suppose if the need really arises and it comes to a point where we do have a lot of people then you can get rid of the lounge figure out what to do with the furniture either distribute it between various offices or put it into storage somewhere
 no no no no this is something that   it started off sort of as a discussion at the coffee table where people were complaining that sort of in the middle of the afternoon they just wanted somewhere to go off and
 no- have some quiet time and that's where it came from
 there are bookshelves in there but it's not really a library because everyone at the moment everyone has a bookshelf in their office and we just go in and borrow books from everyone else it's more really about having a comfortable place to sit um where it's not an office environment it doesn't look anything like an office
 so it's just
 yeah yeah and people can come w- in with their stuff or leave a newspaper or a magazine lying around for other people we've got a bulletin board where you can paste up articles that you think are b- interesting for other people but
 i d-
 well she shares an office so which is why we were thinking that it wouldn't be a problem to s- keep her with a spare person because that's the w- the situation it is right now and if you're a stagieur and you're coming and you don't necessarily expect to have a full blown office if you are only there for about two months
 yeah
 gisella has a fixed schedule for when she's there but david and martin are sort of they f- it fluctuates like they can't say that they'll be there monday tuesday and half of wednesday and not the rest of the time which is part of the problem i mean   they can't s- specify when exactly they'll be there so our rationale for putting them in a three person room is is that it doesn't matter when they're there and whether they're there for certain hours or not it's just either there's two or three people in those rooms and sometimes there's less sometimes there's more because we also don't work fixed hours it's not like we work you know nine to five or whatever everyone sort of keeps their own hours
 yeah
 we have pierrette and marianne in the same
 yeah
 for visitors
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 yeah
 yeah
 i think because it's a fairly new thing it's a little hard to say at this point i think that most people like it now that it's there they sort of see the value of it and they wouldn't want to see it wiped out entirely definitely
  
 yeah
 and that's the danger is
 yeah
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 um okay
 sure either way
 okay well since this one's up keep this one in
 easily go ahead
 uhhuh
 double rooms
 um okay
 pierrette and martin
 uhhuh
 here
 out
 there's two mariannes one is swedish one is finnish so we just call them the swedish and the finnish
 oops
  
   no both start with s  but
 uh it was bruno right
 yeah
 um okay
 in here
 okay
 well for m- martin if you didn't mind working with martin we can switch nancy and martin here
 oops
 yeah ah wrong keyboard
    
 so we can say that this is sort of for but then again you get the more formal visitor in with a bunch of students in a crowded room
 well you can say that this one is for let's say stagieurs or interns
 um
 yeah
  
 well you can move maggie and bruno
 into this room move gisella move the other spare place to the big room but then there's not a lot of people in there
 we're not terribly noisy i think it'll be fine
 yeah and i am too in common with maria and we work on slightly different schedules too because maria and i tend to work earlier and nancy tends to work later so that shouldn't be a problem
 uhhuh
 yeah
 sure
 um so you want to do
 that's going to backfire on me
  
 yeah
 and that's the problem is that you either get smaller desks because the ones that we have now won't fit
 no
  
 i think it's going to be too much
 well maria is fulltime
 so just like that
 okay
 i don't think she cares
  
  
 actu- bruno did mention that he didn't want to be in a room with a lot of people because he did that before and he didn't really like it
 so maybe
 i don't know i can switch with him and we can put him and nancy together i don't mind it doesn't really bother me
 okay yeah
 well the gender balancing we have more women than men in our department anyways so
 no
 okay
 do you see any constraints from any administrative sides
   good question  
 yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah
 uhhuh
 yeah so basically we're moving into a new space but it's
 only marginally better than the old one  
 um sure yeah we can do that
 um okay
 sure
 okay so i'll save that yeah
 okay
  
 the final copy i'll circulate it to everyone along with the numbers that you guys wanted to see in terms of the space
 okay
 great thank you for your time  
 okay
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 so you sa- so pierrette is a professor but she's only she's only fifty per cent time is that why she's in a three person office
 uhhuh
 i see
 um
 uhhuh
   and what what's happening what what do you foresee happening in the next couple of years like beyond this m- b- beyond this current group of people do we do we know of any changes coming is the department growing or is it is it going to be
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
   that's always the case yeah  
 and have you have you talked to th- any of these people to ask them if they have any
 special requirements
 oh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 of people they needed to be near or people they would needed to avoid or anything like that   okay okay alright but you've given people chance to say that if they really needed to okay good
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 it says mountains is that because that's the view yeah so it's the best view you gave the reading room the best view uhhuh
 okay
 oh two mountain views oh and that's old town
 okay okay
 uhhuh
 no okay what's that purple thing there
 oh okay uhhuh
 alright
 okay
 hmm
  
 hmm
 uhhuh
 uhuh
 um
 in the lounge yeah
 uhhuh
 so it's not a place for discussion and it's it's it's a quiet place yeah
 uhhuh
 um i see
 and   so i- there's no are you planning some kind of partition between the lounge and the offices or ar- how are you going to keep those things i think should ask the question to you how are you going to keep them separate because it seems like
 fairly separate functions
   bookcases or something or yeah
 hmm
 but it won't be uh an acoustic separation
 so if if the those are students there so if they're noisy that could disrupt the quiet of the lounge um
 but
 as a separate room
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 but you've also put the lounge in a a very k- kind of a high traffic area where the mailboxes are the printer and the restrooms so that's um
 that may also tha- that may be good for
 meeting people and bumping into people but it's maybe against the idea if it's a very supposed to be an isolated quiet spot
 so i d- um you know
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
  
 um
 well maybe if it if it helps us pack more people into the offices because they have a private lounge maybe it's a good thing saves us money   but uh
 uh yeah i guess that's let's see what is that
 uhhuh
 um yeah
 but you're saying it does get used so you've it's it's not a completely experimental concept your your department has a lounge and it gets used a lot yeah
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
  
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 so can you just summarize briefly the differences between your two proposals the key differences
 uh sh- shared-
 yeah the shared lounge the the assistants with their professors
 in two cases yeah
 oh okay so that's okay yeah
 so yeah
 t  v  at the lounge the admin room separate not shared
 uhhuh
  
 okay so you basically achieve that by giving less space to the reading room i think
 yeah right
 so i guess what one of the questions is how important is the reading room to your group really is it is it something that's a very valued thing that has to be protected um or is it okay to l- make it be kind of this spare space that gets used up a little bit when you need when you have some extra visitors or things like that i think that's
  
 uhhuh
 um yeah
 uhhuh
 but i suppose once it if it gets eaten away a little bit at one some point it becomes unuseful and then yeah so it
   um yeah
 uhhuh
 so what does that mean swedish um
 oh i see   okay   okay
   oh okay
 just s  uh so just to know who they are okay
 i've heard of that  
  
 uhhuh
 uhhuh
 um
 so when you when you put four people in that office does that mean you're planning on four desks you need space for four desks yeah
 do you know if it's possible yeah
 um right
 uhhuh and so you can fit that you think
 uhhuh
 um
 no
 um
